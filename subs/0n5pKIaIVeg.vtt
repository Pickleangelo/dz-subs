WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Um, I didn't tune in at the beginning of your live stream.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.240
What I saw that the, I guess the premise of this conversation is, um, that my God

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.440
is imaginary did have you already given like, um, Oh, like grounding or a base

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.800
for why you think all gods are imaginary?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.060
Or is it, is it just kind of, you're going to fend them off as they come?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.060
It's just your God in particular.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.430
Okay.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.730
Okay.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.490
God, right.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.990
I could say all gods are imaginary, but I feel like that's an unnecessary burden

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.090
because most people believe in a specific God.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.130
And like, if you believe in a deistic God, that's fine.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.850
Like, doesn't, that doesn't change my life.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.770
Doesn't change your life.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.010
Not particularly interesting.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.050
I don't see a reason for a deistic God.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.990
I don't think they solve any actual problems, but, um, like if you believe in

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.210
a deistic God, that's really the least of my worries.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.010
Yeah.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.710
Oh, no, I definitely believe in, uh, um, an imminent God, uh, Jesus Christ, the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.090
son of God, my savior, Yahweh, um, happy, very happy to believe in him.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.510
So, yeah, I guess I'll, I'll, I mean, my, my main reasons for believing in him is

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.610
that, um, he completely changed my heart and mind when I was not looking to be

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.950
changed when I act, I actually was raised by Christians, um, absolutely despised

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.250
them, despised Christianity, could not leave church services fast enough.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.930
Um, and I was forced to go to a summer camp for Christian teenagers and was

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.770
just sick to my stomach about it.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.610
And I heard a story, uh, the story of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that I'd

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130
heard a thousand times before.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.250
And God reached in and just convinced me that he is, he, he was a good God.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.750
He is a good God that he actually interacts with those who seek him,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.790
that those young men knew him.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.110
They knew he was good.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.710
They knew he was worthy of worship and obedience.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.810
And I just started talking to him and he changed my life overnight.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.410
Um, my desires changed completely.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.170
Um, and nobody, I wasn't coached on what I had to do or not do when I went home.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.790
Obviously I was raised as a Christian, so I kind of had an idea, but I was

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.190
completely settled in my pornography, in my demonic video games.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.830
That was what satisfied me and made me happy.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.190
And I went home and was disgusted with all of those things.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.670
Um, ruined a relationship, a very close relationship of mine coming clean of my

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.710
sin, and it's just been a wonderful uphill adventure since then lots of ups and downs.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.510
I wouldn't be honest if I said I've never had doubts, never had, um, questions that

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.590
couldn't be answered when I wanted them to be answered, but God is no more

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.230
imaginary to me than my wife with whom I have three children.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.550
I could be more easily convinced that my wife and I are just brains in a vat.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.250
Um, then that Jesus Christ is the real and true living God.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.030
And so I realized that's subjective and you can't really probably do much with

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.210
that, just as I couldn't argue against something subjective that you would state.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.770
But I would point to, um, significant.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.670
His, what's that?

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.170
You already believe that the Bible is true before you're a Christian.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.840
No, no, I did not.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.580
Well, if the reading, the story of Daniel was enough to change your whole outlook on

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.800
God, then you must've believed that Daniel was true.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.950
I did at that time.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.530
I did.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.510
I did when I heard it.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.650
The Bible says that faith comes by hearing.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.630
I always thought those stories were rubbish.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.070
Didn't you say that he changed your life before you like believed in him?

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.140
I changed my life so that I could believe in him and he changed my life immediately

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.520
upon believing in him.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.820
But you did believe in him.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.420
If the story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego affected you, that means the story had

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.980
some truthfulness to you already.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.740
Right.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.420
So do you understand what Christians believe about faith?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.180
Yep.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.420
Okay.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.460
So faith is a gift from God.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.380
Faith is not, faith is not me coming to a text and saying, Oh, that is true.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.740
Therefore I'm going to believe it.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.880
The Bible says that Satan has blinded our eyes so that we don't see.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.480
He stopped our ears so that we don't hear.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.680
And I've heard that story a hundred times and was completely unaffected.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.100
Sure.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.620
Right.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.520
So, um, but the problem is you're suggesting that faith is from God.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.980
How do you know that faith is from God?

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.730
Um, well, let's see, I'm trying to think of a way that's not circular.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.130
Well, certainly the Bible says faith is from God.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.730
Um, my experience says faith is from God.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.030
Because I, it just happened to me.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.090
I was not looking for it, but you already believe that the Bible is true.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.960
You like, I mean, you're reading the Bible and you believe that the Bible was true.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.240
Yeah.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.860
I mean, I guess I had some, I was okay with, with the non miraculous stories.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.620
I was only 14 at the time.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.160
I wasn't doing a whole lot of diagnostics of which part of the

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.440
Bible were true and which weren't.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.680
Right, right.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.980
Okay.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.020
So you had some belief in the biblical God, even though you didn't follow the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.280
biblical God, then you read the Bible and you read a part that you liked and

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.420
you're like, oh, well, maybe this God isn't so bad.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.480
Oh, yeah, that's an understatement, but yeah.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.800
Okay.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.000
So the fact that he saved, you know, Daniel and his friends, I think is a fun story.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.780
Um, I think there's lots of problems with Daniel.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.940
Daniel is probably one of my favorite books of the major prophets.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.200
Um, the problem I have with Daniel is that it just like gets stuff wrong and

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.680
it's clearly like, um, says things that are untrue and makes predictions that fail.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.120
Um, so like, for example, it says that, uh, Nebuchadnezzar is the father of

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.360
Belshazzar and he's certainly not Nebuchadnezzar is not even related

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.940
to Belshazzar in history.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.360
Belshazzar was the son of King Nabonidus who came four kings after Nebuchadnezzar.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.060
And, uh, the problem is the author didn't know this because the author was writing

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.540
in the middle of the second century, not during the time of Daniel, which is why

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.860
they're very competent with events in the second century.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.160
They get all that stuff, right?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.300
But the author gets the stuff wrong about Daniel's time period because he didn't

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.560
live back then because Daniel didn't write it.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.670
Hmm.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:27.190
Um, so I'm not familiar with this conflict, but I feel like the Greek

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:34.510
Septuagint would prove that statement wrong because that began to be translated

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:42.670
like four or 450 BC and Daniel was certainly in the Greek Septuagint.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.890
So I'm not sure where you're coming up with.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.430
They were, they were writing that in 200 BC.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.070
Well, according to the letter of Aristides, who gives you the narrative of how the

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.390
Greek Septuagint came to be, it was only the first five books of Moses that were

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.650
translated in Egypt, in Alexandria.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.510
The other books came subsequently much later.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.630
And the book of Daniel, in fact, the parts that are relevant to our discussion,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.530
not only are written in the second century, you know, different parts of

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.710
it are written in a form of Hebrew that didn't become popular until the later end

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.730
of the second century.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:23.350
Once they threw off the rule of the Greeks in the, um, uh, revolt from

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.510
Judas Maccabeus and they instituted Hebrew as the national language again.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.030
When they did that, when they reinstituted Hebrew as the national

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:37.250
language, it had a lot of hallmarkers that weren't in proper biblical Hebrew anymore.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.050
It's referred to as Mishneic or Hasmonean Hebrew.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:47.010
And that's the state of the Hebrew text that we find in the majority of the book

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.870
of Daniel, a text that mirrors the second century, late second century,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.130
early first century Hebrew.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.680
Okay.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.260
All right.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.700
I I'm ignorant of that process, so I will take your word for it.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.280
There's a good area for me to do some poking around and educate myself.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.120
So I understand how, um, like reading some of the good parts of the Bible.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.720
If you, if you believe in the Bible, reading some of the good parts of the

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.100
Bible can really like reinforce your faith.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.320
In fact, the Bible says that, uh, you know, uh, believing comes by hearing

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.880
and hearing by the, you know, the reading of the word God, so on and so forth.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.440
But there's a lot of stuff in the Bible that I think would push you in the other

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:32.920
direction.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.040
So Mac brought up earlier, the fact that God allows for slavery seems to be like

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.520
a very problematic part of the Bible that people seem like seem to overlook all the time.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.450
Oh yeah.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.070
We, we chatted this one up a little bit.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.530
Uh, unfortunately I couldn't hear your caller cause I'm on my phone.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:58.550
I guess there's something going on with the, with that technology, but, um, yeah,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:03.350
I have no problem with the version of slavery that is in the Old Testament.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.890
In fact, I went so far as to say, I would have no problem being a slave under those

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:17.450
circumstances because it was entirely, um, a situation of justice, meaning it was for

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:24.370
the reconciliation of the debts and the repayment of, in many cases like war crimes

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.510
or, or just the expense of war.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:34.550
And so, you know, I heard you talking about, uh, what sounded like a trickery of the

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.610
master, giving them a, uh, a wife and children, et cetera.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:44.430
And then the mass, then the male slave could go out or stay, but you know what, what the

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.690
scripture says about the maximum length of time that a slave could serve.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:53.810
There was no such thing as a perpetual, um, non-voluntary slave.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.830
How much money would you wager on that?

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.830
As far as the Hebrews, how much money would you wager on that?

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.500
Well, you sound pretty confident.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.360
So I better not wager much to my reading of scripture.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.820
I, I remembered that there's, there's standard was seven years and then there was

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.280
the year of Jubilee.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.280
Um, so you could serve a maximum of 50 years, but the, so the, the time of servitude

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:27.360
was based on the indebtedness and the whole concept of kidnapping somebody

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.660
to get a slave, the Bible calls for the death penalty for somebody who just took

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.880
somebody without cause for a slave.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.840
And so, and, and it's even laid out in Leviticus that the whole congregation was

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:47.380
to be kind of snitches on the masters of slaves, to make them accountable, to

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:55.460
treat their slaves kindly, to not be ruthless masters, that's not in Leviticus.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.200
Oh yeah, it is.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.240
Yeah, it is.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.760
All right, we'll, we'll, we'll get them.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.340
I want to read to you a passage before we get Leviticus.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.700
Uh, for the Hebrews, we'll look at it.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.980
It says, when you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall serve you for six years.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.760
But in the seventh year, he shall go out a free person without debt.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.220
If he comes in single, he shall go out single.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.720
If he comes in married, his wife shall go out with him.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.360
If his master gives him a wife and she bears some sons or daughters, the wife

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.560
of her children, I'm sorry, the wife and her children shall go out alone.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.000
I'm sorry.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.180
Let me read that again.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.460
The wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out alone.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.020
There we go.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:44.640
So according to Exodus, uh, if you are a man and you go into service and the

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.600
master gives you a woman to, uh, have children by, have a family by any

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.480
children that you have with that woman, they're still permanent slaves.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.640
They didn't, they didn't do any wrong.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.520
They didn't owe any debt.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.190
I don't think that's correct.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:11.230
I think there's, there were other laws that just made it ipso facto that nobody,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.690
no Hebrew was to be a permanent slave.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.250
Sure.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.830
Find me.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:15.610
Where are you getting it?

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:21.990
Just, just a second, just because the man went out before the wife and children

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.010
does not mean the wife and children would not go out when their time was served.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.030
Well, let me read it again.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.290
Maybe, um, I, you don't see the screen.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.470
You can only hear me talking.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.650
So maybe I'll that that's, that's just because you can't see what I see.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.570
Exodus 21 for if his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters,

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:47.210
the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out alone.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.950
Okay.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.570
So, so he goes out alone.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.430
Yeah.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.130
Because the, does that, does that necessarily mean that his wife and

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.590
children remain slaves for their entire life?

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.130
Yes.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.170
That's, that's why he's going out alone.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:14.630
It was, so you, if you, if I'm serving a jail sentence of nine years and my

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.270
years, I'm going to go out alone.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.470
And then at the 10th year, my friend is going to go out.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.730
I still went out alone.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.510
Well, it doesn't say anything about women being going to go out.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.790
Right.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:30.370
It says that, um, the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.350
alone and saying, so after the terms of service, after seven years, they're

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.530
going to go out alone.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:41.910
Now, if in fact she's there serving a six year, um, indentured servitude as

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.970
well, well, then she would go out before him.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.110
She'd already be released.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:46.090
Right.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.370
Cause you only serve for six years, but as it turns out, the women didn't

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.150
serve for six years, they serve for life.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.090
Verse seven, when a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.750
go out as the male slaves do.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:14:59.670
Right.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.610
So the women and the children are permanent slaves.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.080
Yeah.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.420
I'm, I'm not certain about that interpretation.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.980
Um, I'm pretty sure that that would be basically the idea of purchasing a bride.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.360
Um, I'm not sure how to reconcile that.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.260
It's funny that it says slave and not bride.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.260
Yeah.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:23.940
Yep.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.020
I will grant you that.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:25.800
Right.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.960
If it was about purchasing a bride, it would just say a wife.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.260
It'd say Esha.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.120
Yeah.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.900
It says if she does not please her master, who has designated her for

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.000
himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.400
He shall have.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.020
So there's, there's something going on here besides just like a common

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.260
slave because it's designated for himself.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:50.780
Yeah.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.560
She's like a concubine.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:52.900
Yeah.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.300
That's a slave, a slave wife.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:55.900
Okay.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.760
I'm reading a little bit further in the passage just to make sure I'm getting

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.380
the context.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.710
Okay.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:16.030
So in verse 10, it says, if he takes another wife to himself, he shall

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.710
not diminish her food or clothing or her marital rights.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:19.410
I'm aware.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.770
And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall not, she shall

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.170
go out for nothing without payment of money, right?

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.370
Cause she's a slave life.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.230
Okay.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.610
Yeah.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:36.770
So I'd, I'd be interested in definitely digging deeper into that, but you

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.270
understand that there's a difference between being just a common slave and

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:47.090
a slave wife, not that as a woman, I would want to be either based on how

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.810
I'm currently understanding this passage, but it's definitely different than

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.790
just you've kidnapped somebody and now the Bible tells you how to treat them.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.190
I didn't say anything about kidnapping.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.350
I'm talking about a woman being sold by her father into concubinage.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.540
Do you think she should have autonomy over these decisions?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.300
Or do you think a man should just be able to sell his daughter?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.300
Yeah.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.060
Well, so there's, there's definitely an authority structure in scripture

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:27.620
as to a woman's ability to like take a vow and the man's ability to either

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:33.320
let the vow go and, and her be held to it or the man being able to override

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.660
that bow and say, no, that bow does not apply to you in the book of numbers.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:36.960
Yeah.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.820
So there's something, yeah, there's something here, but, um, I'm not sure.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.120
I will have to, uh, I'll have to yield on this point until I

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.100
can look a little deeper.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.500
Now, God does allow you to kidnap people in Deuteronomy 20 and 21.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.540
Have you read that?

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.480
Um, let me go there.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.480
I'm sure that I've read it.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:09.110
So 20, they go to 20 verse 10 says, when you draw near, uh, to a town

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.330
to fight against it, offer it terms of peace.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.390
If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders you, then all the people

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.130
in it shall serve you as forced labor.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.250
If it does not submit to you peacefully, but makes war against you,

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.530
then you shall besiege it.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.970
And when the Lord your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.130
of the males to the sword.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.150
You may however, take as your booty, the women, children, livestock,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.490
and everything else in the town.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.570
All of it spoil.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.810
You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given you.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:46.110
And then in the next chapter, God says, Hey, if you have these women that are

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.230
wife, you can go into her.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.950
It sounds, it sounds like kidnapping and concubinage.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.020
I agree with you on that, uh, assessment.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.280
Um, I got to get a better read on this.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.220
What you said, Deuteronomy 20, what was, where was the start?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.300
First of that Deuteronomy 20, 2010, 2010.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.900
So, I mean, my first, my first thought is that Israel, apart from the land of

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.880
Canaan, Israel only fought defensive wars.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.740
So in the land of Canaan, they were told to go.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.680
This is talking about towns that are far away from you.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.190
Did Israel ever do that?

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.550
Well, I don't know if it, well, according to the narrative, they didn't, but God is

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.810
giving you commands here on what to do with towns that are far away from you.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.230
Verse 15 says, thus, you shall treat all of the towns that are very far from you,

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.610
which are not towns of the nations here.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.530
Where's 15.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.250
So he's in these towns that are far away from you.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.450
Hey, go and fight against them and offer them terms of peace.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:11.790
If they don't agree to be your forced labor, then you can, uh, take all of the

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.730
males, put them to the sword, commit genocide, kidnap their women and children.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:25.820
Okay.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.320
Cool.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.720
We've given me three things to think about.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.340
That's certainly something, isn't it?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.920
And then I, you know, since we're already here, since we're already on the

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.880
topic and since I don't talk about it enough, personally, I think this passage

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.040
gets a lot of airtime, so I don't give it as much airtime, but since we're here,

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.600
we should talk about numbers 31 where God allows and commands these little virgin

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.980
children to be divvied, divvied up to the war, uh, soldiers, um, after they go to

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.080
war against the people group that they were supposed to completely annihilate.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.120
And then they don't annihilate them.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.600
Moses gets mad and says, Eliezer, the priest and all the leaders of the

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.160
congregation went to meet them outside of the camp.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.300
Moses became angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.480
and the commanders of hundreds who came from the service of war.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.120
Moses said to them, have you allowed the women to live?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.800
These women here on Balaam's advice made the Israelites act treacherously

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.180
against the Lord in the affair of Peor so that the plague came among

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.240
the congregation of the Lord.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.380
Now, therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman who

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.320
has known a man by sleeping with them.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.400
But all the young girls, it literally says children in Hebrew, hataf, all

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.880
the, the young girls, little children, girls who have not known a man by

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.620
sleeping with them, keep alive for yourselves.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.200
And then later in the chapter, God commands them to distribute these

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.320
virgin girls among the soldiers.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:00.880
Okay.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.640
I apologize.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.240
I'm very slow.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.180
You said numbers 31.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.060
Yeah.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.340
Verse 15 through 18.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:08.980
Okay.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.930
Ah, okay.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:21.350
So this is a specific case of the, the Midianites, correct?

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.030
Exactly.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.390
Yeah.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:27.190
So there was a situation in the book of numbers where the Midianite, some of

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:35.210
the Midianite women enticed the Israelites to practice idolatry and this upset God

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.170
a whole lot.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:40.550
Yes.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.690
Okay.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:51.710
Well, um, I don't have an answer for these right now.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.970
I do have a question about these though.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.210
Um, is it possible?

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:05.130
So in the, in the new Testament, the, the scribes and the Pharisees approached

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:11.410
Christ with some conundrums, one of which is being, uh, questions of divorce.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.290
And Jesus said that divorce was never.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.630
Divorce was, was given to them because of the hardness of their heart.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.870
Yeah.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:21.930
Matthew 19.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.580
Um, say that again, I think it's in Matthew 19, right?

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.190
Oh man.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.850
You're fantastic.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.370
Um, I don't know.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.830
Um, yeah.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.170
But anyway, so, so they were, there have been things, there were things given to

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:45.750
the people of Israel because of their hardness of heart, things that Christ

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:51.670
admitted were in themselves, not good, but it was the best way to corral the

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.310
sin of those people at the time.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:58.930
It was not the ideal, um, but it was given to them because of the

00:23:58.930 --> 00:23:59.670
hardness of their heart.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.970
Anyway, is it possible?

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.270
I understand what you're saying.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.730
I, it is very common apologetic, right?

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.890
But the question I would ask is what does God say about the commands?

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.810
Cause God says that these commands are perfect and to follow them forever.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:20.690
And it sounds like Jesus now is contradicting Yahweh on the role of the

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:27.230
law, and I would add one more thing to that, which is that Jesus is only

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.590
referring to divorce here.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.110
Like we know, like according to the New Testament narrative, we know that Jesus

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:39.190
is suggesting that the law on divorce isn't God's ultimate plan, but he didn't

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.010
tell us anything about any of the other laws, right?

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:49.250
So you, you're inferring now that because Jesus suggested that the law of divorce

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.170
wasn't God's original command, that we can apply that principle to all the laws.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.630
But how do we decide which laws to apply that to and which ones not to?

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.070
Yeah.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.710
So that's a good point.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.970
What, where I was trying to get to with that, and I think I was doing a bad

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:12.450
job of getting there was, was to basically say the New Testament presents

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.830
us with more of the ideal.

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:19.130
It presents us with freedom for slaves.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:25.790
It presents us with the complete equality of men, women, slave free,

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.070
barbarian, Scythian.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:36.050
And I think that if it were not for you growing up in a New Testament

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:41.370
effected culture, you would not even bat an eye at these issues of slavery.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.250
If you were to have grown up in India, for instance, just about any

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.670
part of the Middle East.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.830
Where does the Bible say that slavery is wrong?

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.030
It does not say that slavery is wrong.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.550
So the God clearly says slavery is not wrong.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:00.610
He says to do it.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.390
And he says to follow the law code forever.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.310
But in the New Testament we're shown.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:15.210
So the, the law in the Old Testament is to establish what is justice.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:22.150
What is just raw, raw, unadulterated justice.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.250
So it's just own sight.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.010
And there's a lot of vengeance.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:29.090
There is a lot of bloodshed in the Old Testament because it's just, it's

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.090
justice, God uses the people of Israel to kill people that never did anything

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.570
against Israel, but they offend God.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.290
And God was calling for their slavery.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.030
As I said, slavery was primarily for the repayment of debt.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.450
But I don't understand, right.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.490
I don't understand.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:47.710
Yeah.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:55.350
I don't understand the context, the historical context of the, um, the bride

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:02.250
of slaves, I don't think, well, yeah, I'm not going to speculate on that, but

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.810
anyway, so, so to continue with my point, I think you would not bat an eye if you

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.830
had this, these passages of slavery, if you had not been raised in a Christian

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:19.770
culture, it has taken slavery Christians endorsed it, uh, the whole

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.630
world endorsed slavery and it was Christians who abolished it.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:23.150
That's wrong.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.170
Literally the Southern Baptist convention, the largest denomination

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:32.590
in America created itself in order to reinforce segregation and slavery.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:35.150
Okay.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.430
So you're telling me that all of Christianity must be defined

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.270
by the Southern Baptist association.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.990
What I'm saying is that your definition of Christianity, which is anti-slavery

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:50.370
is a tiny fraction of Christianity for the majority of Christian history.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:54.110
They fought tooth and nail against freeing the slave.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:58.930
That's why Jefferson Davis gave multiple speeches saying that slavery is the

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.610
only method by which the degraded race has been brought to salvation.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.110
That's why the vice president of the Confederacy mentioned that God created,

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:13.550
uh, the, the Negro people to be subservient to the white people so that

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:19.010
they can come to saving grace through what was given through our race over

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:23.150
and over again, we've got quotations from that sentiment found in the Bible.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.770
Is that sentiment that you're quoting?

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.330
Is that found in the new Testament?

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.770
Where Paul urges Philemon to release the slave and count him his brother.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:38.530
And where it's known that Christians, the early church were balked at because

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:43.490
they accepted slaves into the congregations and gave them equal rights in the church.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.330
Well, having, having being allowed in the church doesn't make you not a slave.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.760
Correct.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.140
And even the early church fathers, they were considered brothers.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.180
They were considered brothers of the early church.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.640
They weren't considered lesser.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.730
They were still concerned slaves though, possibly under what

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.350
circumstances we don't know again.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:17.110
Like I said, if I was, if I was a prisoner of war, if we went, if we went, uh, to

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.850
war with the country that defeated us, I would be happy.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.230
I mean, I would obviously rather that they did to us, what America did to

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.170
Europe and just rebuild everything and gift them back everything that was destroyed.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.210
But the reality was that most of the time slavery was a repayment of war debt.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.530
That's not true.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.830
Um, I believe it is, uh, as far as the Hebrew, as far as the

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.930
Hebrews, as far as the Hebrews I'm talking about.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.050
It's not the Hebrews didn't go to war with each other.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.280
No, not with each other.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.240
So that's not a slave debt.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.260
And that's why, that's why with each other, they could only serve, they

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.780
could only serve seven years.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.980
If you're a male, if you're a foreigner or if you're a woman, you were in there

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:09.820
for life, um, so I mean, according to the code, if you were a foreigner that

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.880
went to war with them, didn't say that.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.380
Sure.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.800
It does.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.120
No, it talks all over the place.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.860
about taking care of the foreigner.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.580
They didn't just somebody come knocking on their door and, Oh, here, look,

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.420
here's a new slave and they enslave them.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.940
There were specific guidelines about how to treat the foreigner.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.740
Oh, all right.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.640
Well, I guess today's the day you learn Leviticus 25.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.660
All right.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:36.060
Leviticus 25 says, um, as for the male and female slaves who you may have, it

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.640
is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.300
You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you and from their

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.760
families.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.660
Now families isn't actually in there.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.240
What, what's the passage again?

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:48.540
I'm sorry.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.400
You said 25.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.340
Yeah, Leviticus 25, 44 through 46.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.020
I'm there.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.420
Cool.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.140
Right.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.420
So it doesn't actually say family in the Hebrew text.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.200
It says from their sons, meaning the children, right?

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.240
Says, uh, from their sons that are with you who've been born in your land, they

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.320
may be your property.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.060
You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.060
inherit his property.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:18.880
It's easy.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.220
You may treat as slaves.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.180
And so if they had children, their children were born into slavery.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.920
These are perpetual slaves.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.420
Sorry, I'm just trying to catch up.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.420
Yeah, I'm not fast enough.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.540
I'm gonna, uh, I'm going to bog this thing down.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:09.080
If I try and understand this passage, but this is another good one.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.420
I'm writing these things down, man.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.340
I appreciate, uh, I appreciate learning for sure.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.380
Definitely jot them down.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.740
Uh, they're kind of important and we've got lots of texts from the early church

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.920
talking, uh, and even from Pope's talking about how slavery was okay.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.620
Ambrose is probably one of the most famous Ambrose of Milan talked about how

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.840
slavery was, was a necessary thing.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.140
Like it was needed.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.100
Yeah.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.300
Well, I'm, I'm Protestant.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.020
So that particular argument doesn't affect me, but fair enough.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.260
Um, you've given it up so far.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.520
Yeah.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.120
So, um, I think like the, the issue of slavery is kind of a big issue.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.720
That's why it comes up so a lot, uh, so much in apologetic circles is because

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.980
yeah, I think most people, whether you're a Christian or not, most people

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.500
understand like slavery is not good.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.460
It's not a good thing.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.800
And so when we see the God of the Bible, slavery, the funny thing is, the

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.180
funny thing is that's not true.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.380
What you just said about most people recognizing slavery is not good.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.340
I'm sorry.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.820
Most people in 2025 America recognize slavery is not good.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.420
I agree.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.040
But you've heard the stats probably more often than I have.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.100
There are more slaves.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.000
There are more people in slavery today than there were ever worded during

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.220
the Atlantic slave trade.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.000
Only if you have.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.600
So most of the world does not think that slavery is bad.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.600
Only if you have a very loose idea of what slavery is.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.540
Also not as a percentage.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.540
Yeah, it's certainly not as a percentage.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.020
Okay.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:38.660
I see.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.920
Just overall number.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:40.780
Yeah.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.630
Well, yeah, I guess so.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:50.190
So what is your, what is your particular beef with slavery?

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.610
Why, why is that offensive to you?

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:57.870
I know why, I know why I'm troubled by these passages that I can't wrap my

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.890
mind around and I know why I'm going to wrestle with them, but why are they

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.810
offensive to you?

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.850
I don't think that people are property.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.790
Why not?

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.510
Because people are people.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.330
Is it okay for people to have pets?

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.030
I don't think pets are necessarily property, but also pets are not the

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.370
same thing as property.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.950
Like, so when we take in pets, they're become a member of the family.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.800
Uh, I don't think that's the case with a herd of cattle or a herd of chicken.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.020
Cattle aren't chicken.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.260
Right.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.580
But they're animals, they're animals and their property.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.260
I mean, maybe you're a vegan.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:36.980
I don't know.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.000
I mean, I'm not vegan, but I'm super sympathetic to the vegan position.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.060
I don't believe that our pets are necessary slaves to us.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.180
I think they're family members.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:49.740
Okay.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.380
I disagree with that, but.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.240
I mean, talk, talk to my cat.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:58.560
She, she lives better than, than a lot of humans in the planet.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:34:59.760
I'm sorry.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.180
He, my dog would be on your side of this argument.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.280
Anyway, obviously cats are on my side.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.040
Dogs are on my side.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.980
Cats are on your side.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:10.940
Yeah.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:16.960
Cats are not obedient like dogs, but, but why is the concept of, so

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.480
like, like in the animal kingdom and I can't spot any, but there's, there's

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.240
lots of, um, examples I've heard of over the years of different animals,

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:31.040
enslaving other animals, um, particularly in like the fish world.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.980
Um, are those examples offensive to you or?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.320
I don't think that fish are necessarily like have the thinking capacity of humans.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.660
I think that's what sets us apart.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:52.040
Human beings have this incredible sense of, of, uh, morality and also the

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.720
ability to logic and reason, whereas a lot of animals don't have the

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.000
same level of cognition.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.600
So I wouldn't put on the animals, the same sense of moral responsibility

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.740
that I would put on humans.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.680
So would it be okay if I enslaved somebody who is badly mentally damaged?

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.040
I think that would be bad.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.320
Yeah.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.460
Who didn't have, who, who, what's that?

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.760
Yeah, I think that'd be bad.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.720
That'd be bad.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.200
Okay.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:21.660
So it's not, it's not our cognition then that you're arguing if, if enslaving

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.580
somebody who hardly knows their left foot from their right is also offensive

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.300
to you, there must be something else that's offensive to you about slavery.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.780
Thinking you have reasoning capacity, right?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.240
Which means, you know, that, um, owning another human being is, is not

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.500
beneficial to the person that you own and treating them like a slave.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.640
What does beneficial have to do with it?

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.160
Well, I'm an atheist.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.340
I don't believe that you, I'm assuming that you hold to the survival of the

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.160
fittest as to how we got to where we are today.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.880
Survival of the fittest is a mechanism of evolution, not morality.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:07.770
Well, if, if that mechanism has led to our society, doesn't that automatically

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.850
mean it's right and what we ought to go with?

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.850
No survival of the fittest is not a moral code.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:18.830
Survival of the fittest is the ability to survive, not the ability to kill

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.010
people that are weaker than you.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.550
Like you can be the fittest in your society and survive and produce

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.050
offspring without going back and murdering all those that are not as fit as you.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:32.150
Right.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.330
But I guess what I'm getting at, I mean, you know what I'm getting at.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.970
We're just, we're trying to parry here, but, um,

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.590
I think what you want to do, and if I, if I was in your shoes, Joe, uh, I

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:47.610
think this is about the time I would pivot to the moral argument, which is

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.130
basically to say that atheists don't have any morals, we can't have any morals

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.570
because we don't believe in an objective moral lawgiver.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:56.910
Well, I wasn't going there.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.770
I was actually, I think that you do have morals.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:05.030
I just think that they're screwed up and that you borrow from

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.630
Christianity where your morals fail.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.510
What did I borrow?

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:14.290
So I don't see how you could, I don't see how you could say me acting out the

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.390
exact same thing that's been going on for millions of years, if you believe in

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.510
evolution, just the survival of the fittest, the strong take what they need

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.310
from the weak and the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.490
That's not how you could say to me doing that.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:29.530
It's not, of course it is.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.230
No, it's not.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.830
You don't, you don't.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:38.670
I own chickens and, um, surround with the fittest is very much at play there in

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.050
the chickens, as far as when one of them is slightly sick or down, the others

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.710
peck at it and chase it away from the food so that they can get more.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:46.950
Yeah.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.750
Well, we're talking about human.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:54.010
Well, so humans evolved completely different than other, than other creatures.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.330
What I'm saying is that human beings have a different mechanism.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:00.290
Human beings have a higher sense of thinking capacity and we're also

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.870
social creatures that survive based on our, our function within our own society.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.450
Right.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.070
So like, I wouldn't hold chicken to the same moral standard as humans.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:10.670
Right.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:18.510
But according to evolution, atheism, did we not get here to where we are as a

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:23.930
higher thinking people by those same mechanisms that cause a healthy chicken

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.690
to peck away an unhealthy chicken?

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.070
Um, only partially involved by a completely different

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.550
means.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.970
I think it's a combination of factors, right?

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.750
So there are a combination of factors that allow us to survive our

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.110
environment better than others.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.690
This is what I was saying before is survival.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:44.350
The fittest doesn't mean that you have to harm those that are not as fit as you

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:49.030
survival of the fittest just means that you are reaping the most benefit from

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.830
surviving in the highest level of capacity.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.470
Whereas the person who's not quite so equipped, isn't going to either

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.410
reproduce or reproduce enough.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.120
But, but you and I both know that's not how it works in nature.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.640
Um, there's only so many, what's that with humans or animals?

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:11.840
Yeah.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.080
Yeah.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:18.460
But there's only so many acorns for each squirrel and it's a race to see who can

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.260
get enough, right?

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.780
I'm just using the analogy of survival of the fittest.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.780
Cause you don't think it, you know, because your moral compass has been

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.880
tuned by Christianity, you know, that the survival of the fittest is

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.740
actually immoral.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.640
No, I don't believe that it is.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.460
I don't believe the survival of the fittest entails that you have to

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.740
degrade those who are not as fit as you.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.640
And Christianity has nothing to do with it.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.360
Christianity says that slavery is okay.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.420
In fact, Christianity, there's always limited resources, always limited

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.140
resources.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.260
Christianity enshrines survival of the fittest.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.600
Christianity says that you can enslave people that fall into debt or that

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.100
their country loses the war.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:07.120
Christianity enshrines God's mercy to anybody who will have it regardless

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.720
of weakness or strength.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.640
It's definitely not mercy.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.560
It's survival of the fittest.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.640
Slavery is not mercy.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.090
No, I will grant you, I will grant you slavery is not mercy.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.050
Based on the circumstances, it might also not be atrocity.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.970
It might just be raw justice.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:24.850
Justice.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.310
Again, I got to look at these passages cited for me.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.550
What are the children born into slavery being held to justice for?

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.520
Such an excellent question.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.920
I don't know the answer to that.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.040
I don't have to borrow from Christianity.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.660
In fact, secular morals have been fighting against Christianity forever.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.900
Secular morals is what brought you suffrage, whereas Christianity tried to

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.640
hold women, women back.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.120
What Christian moral am I borrowing?

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:03.000
You are borrowing, hopefully do unto others as you would have them do unto

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.960
you constantly.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.820
That existed way before the Bible.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:07.880
Okay.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.240
Well, it's in the Bible, so it's a Christian moral.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.320
It's not a Christian moral.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.680
That's a universal principle that almost all societies have recognized.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.640
Oh, really?

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.500
Yeah.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.660
Read the Babylonian wisdom literature.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.720
That's garbage.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080
That's absolute garbage.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.160
Not only is it not garbage, it's in the Babylonian literature, it's in the

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.800
Egyptian literature, and it's even in the Stoics.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.820
Read the 47th letter of Seneca.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.070
It's possible that they wrote about it.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.190
I know they wrote about it.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.560
Okay.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:42.980
Well, good.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.160
They did write about it.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.760
Well, the Jews and the Christians didn't do it either.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.040
The Christians have done it far better than, well, the Jews and the Christians

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.640
have done it far better than any other group.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.400
I disagree.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.180
The Christians were the largest segment trying to keep segregation

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.520
and slavery in America.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:13.780
Well, I'm ignorant on that topic, but I know it was Christians who were willing

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.280
to kill hundreds of thousands of their fellow countrymen in order to stop slavery.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.320
It was non-Christians.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.060
That was not happening in Arabia, that was not happening in Africa, that was not

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.120
happening in Asia, that was happening where Christians were in charge.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.920
They were fighting fellow Christians.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.440
Right, but they were still fighting.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.580
Against Christians.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.100
Yes, in many cases.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.860
And do you know that there were secularists also fighting and deists and people that

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.460
weren't Christian fighting for the North?

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:48.330
Oh yeah, I'm sure.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:49.310
Okay.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:53.710
So the fact that there weren't Christians that opposed slavery says nothing to

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.110
whether or not Christianity abolished slavery.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:05.240
But it's a strange coincidence that it was two Christian nations that primarily

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.140
led the charge to abolish slavery.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.060
They literally did not.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.700
They literally did.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.940
They literally did not.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:23.900
Well, I'm not 12, so I'm not going to go on with this, but yeah, so I guess, I

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.880
mean, still just back to the whole idea of morality, I still don't understand why

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:40.700
you're separating the mechanism that brought us to where we are today from a

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.540
survival of the fittest.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.800
There are limited resources, the strong need to take those resources because the

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.300
weak are just going to waste those resources.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.360
That's not what survival of the fittest is.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.800
That absolutely is.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.840
No, it's not.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.200
Yes, it is.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:00.920
Most not.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:10.360
The sickly, runtly chicken or squirrel get pecked and chased away from the

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.060
food so the stronger, healthier ones can get it and survive and breed.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.880
We're talking about humans.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.400
I know, but you consider humans to be animals, don't you?

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:28.900
I mean, every living creature that has thinking capacity is technically an animal.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.160
Yeah, so why are you differentiating between humans and chickens?

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.440
Because your Dawkins wouldn't differentiate.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:43.580
He would because we have an intellect that is different from chickens.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.680
We have a higher level of reasoning than chickens have because we have a higher

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:54.000
level of reasoning and rational capacity, we're held to a higher level, a higher

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.260
standard to match our level of reasoning ability.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:03.250
Okay, so I'll make it, I'm trying to boil it down because I'm not a great

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:03.890
communicator.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:10.610
If one of my healthy chickens sees one of my sickly chickens eating, and that

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:14.110
healthy chicken goes and pecks at the other one so that it runs away and doesn't

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.270
feed that day, was that morally wrong or was it morally neutral?

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:22.450
I just told you chickens aren't held to the same moral standards as humans because

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:26.970
they have a different level of thinking and reasoning capacity as we do, which is

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:33.870
why it's silly to ask whether or not chickens are doing things that are

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:35.110
capacity that we do.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:39.870
We have abstract thinking capacity, which means we're held to a different standard

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:40.590
than chickens.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.580
Who's holding us to a different standard?

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.160
We are as human beings.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.160
We have a different level of abstract thinking.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:59.050
Okay, so what if my two-year-old and my three-year-old did the exact same thing

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.810
that my chickens, that I described my chicken doing?

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.970
They also have a diminished level of abstract thinking.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.790
Children need to be reared because their brain is not yet developed.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:15.190
Their brain doesn't fully develop until their late teenage years, early 20s, which

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:20.630
is why we don't let teenagers decide to smoke cigarettes or to join the military

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.890
or to own firearms because they have a diminished thinking capacity.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:36.960
Okay, so is a two-year-old smacking the waffle out of the other child's hand, is

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.180
that morally okay?

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.060
Because of their diminished capacity or is it still wrong?

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.160
It's neither.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.840
It's neither wrong nor okay.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.960
It's a behavior that they haven't have any time to think about it because they

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.020
haven't developed the capacity to think on those guidelines.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:59.780
In fact, there only is morally developed as like a household pet at that point,

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.660
maybe less.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.940
Two-year-olds, like the amount of reasoning capacity is like, I need milk

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.180
and give me milk, that's it.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:09.860
Right.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.140
Yeah, I understand that.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:19.300
I'm just trying to figure out where I feel like you're putting up a wall to

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:27.640
divide what you and I both know is right and wrong from what you claim is neutral.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:35.440
No, what I'm saying is that entities that have the capacity to reason and think

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.720
are held to a higher standard than animals that don't have the capacity to

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.740
reason and think.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.880
Why is that the case?

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.320
Because it's unrealistic to expect animals to behave in a way that is against

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.540
their biological nature.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.580
They're incapable of engaging in the same level of discourse as we are.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.700
So it's unrealistic to expect them to do so.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:06.470
Okay.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:12.330
So you're saying that humans should not always give into their more bestial

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:17.330
instincts, that there is a right and wrong that they should do instead of what

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:18.690
their instincts tell them to do.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.170
Yes, we finally got there.

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.610
It took us 15, 20 minutes to get there.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:27.130
We finally arrived at the argument of saying that I don't have any business of

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.590
saying what is right and wrong because I don't believe in objective morals and

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:31.330
you do.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.490
So do you want to have that conversation?

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.430
No, I want to continue on the conversation.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.850
We're on.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.530
Okay.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.730
I tried to fast forward the conversation.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:42.680
All right.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.920
No, I'm trying to get more of a baseline.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:51.120
I'm trying to get more of a baseline because I believe, um, I believe many

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.220
atheists have as good or maybe even a better moral compass in some cases.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.360
Sounds like we don't need God then.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.320
Didn't he just say our morals are screwed up?

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:01.920
Um, that's what I heard.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:02.540
Eight minutes ago.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.140
I did.

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:08.780
Yes.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.640
So I believe that atheists can be good and kind.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.660
Um, and I believe that that is the grace of God.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:23.680
I don't believe that they, I don't believe that you have any reason from

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:33.630
your worldview to say that my three-year-old should not smack another

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:36.330
three-year-old who has something that my three-year-old wants.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.010
I think I can say that.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:38.390
Yes.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:40.730
Okay.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:41.970
Give it to me.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:45.790
Because we live in a society where we agree that there are things that are

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:48.050
good and bad for society and for the individual.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:52.250
And if you teach your children to smack other children and take their toys and

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:57.670
they grow up believing it's okay to abuse other children, and even from a

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:02.230
purely selfish standpoint, you could see why if I have a child, I want

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:03.850
your child to not abuse mine.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.430
And if I want my child to not be abused, then it's in my best benefit to

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:12.610
make sure that we live in a society where children are not encouraged

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:13.710
to abuse each other.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:17.650
So even from a completely subjective moral framework, I can tell you that

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:21.510
it's not good to allow your child to steal and to abuse another child

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:26.290
simply because it yields negative benefits in the long run for the

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.550
individual and for society.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.250
What if that other child is sickly and it's probably going to die in the

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:38.330
next two years and they're just wasting the society's resources?

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.070
Which one?

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:40.010
The ones that are being abused?

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.590
The one that's being abused, yeah.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.850
Then you're still doing a bad thing because the person or the child that's

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:48.390
doing the abuse is still learning bad behaviors.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:52.030
Also, the child has no way of knowing that.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.510
What if it's not a bad thing?

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:55.810
What if they're learning the specifics?

00:51:55.910 --> 00:52:00.030
You can abuse people who are wasting the group's resources.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:04.510
Human beings have no way of knowing which human beings are complete waste.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:08.770
All they have is their limited purview of what a human being is doing.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.050
Oh, I think, I mean, I think we can.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:20.910
I know several people that just from a physical standpoint, and I know

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:25.390
this is going to be taken the wrong way, but just from a purely physical

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:27.950
Darwinian standpoint, they are a waste of resources.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.970
They're not going to reproduce and they can't contribute anything to society.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.870
Wrong again.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.730
And just because somebody doesn't reproduce, doesn't mean that they

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.030
don't contribute to society.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:41.970
No, I didn't, I didn't say, I didn't say they don't reproduce.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:43.430
And so they don't contribute.

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.970
I said, they don't reproduce or contribute.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:47.350
How do they not contribute?

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:50.690
They cannot have a job.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.290
They are completely dependent on the government for extensive health care,

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:57.270
all their food, housing, et cetera.

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:00.570
My son is completely nonverbal autistic.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.530
Do you think my son contributes to my life?

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.530
Do you think I should off my show?

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.470
Is, do you, is that what you think I'm saying?

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:12.930
That's exactly what you're saying.

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.490
You're saying children that are born with disabilities that can't actually

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:21.430
contribute financially to society would be better off being abused by children

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:26.330
that could, but as a father of a special needs child, I can say that that's

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:29.590
probably the most horrific thing I've heard in a very long time.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:31.090
Wow.

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:36.350
So that's why exactly why I said don't take this the weird way because I was

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:39.490
pretty sure you probably would take it the weird out of context way.

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.430
I was giving you a hypothetical situation.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:46.330
I know it was a horrific Darwinian mechanism by which we have arrived at

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:50.890
some and this great peak is rubbish because we know that's not the

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:53.310
Darwinian mechanism as it actually happens.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.390
Yes, it is.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.950
No, it's not.

00:53:55.210 --> 00:54:02.230
We got to where we are by random mutation and the culling of weak mutations,

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:07.010
the culling of weak individuals in the animal kingdom and in the human kingdom

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.810
is the human kingdom isn't built upon destroying the weak.

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:15.450
In fact, we've got evidence all the way going back to the Neanderthals that

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:19.570
they were helping healing and allowing the injured to live.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:24.790
We, we do better as a society when society supports even the weakest in

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:27.750
society that makes the society strong.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:32.150
The society that you're advocating for is not one that is represented

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:33.190
in human history.

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:37.850
Okay.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.250
Then I think, yeah, I don't think that disproves my point.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.750
I think that just, that's, that means that we, we didn't, all of a sudden

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:51.670
the mechanism of evolution suddenly flipped the script at some point.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:55.630
You just fundamentally misunderstand how survival of the fittest works.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.040
All right.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:03.120
Explain to me in simple terms that my little brain can comprehend how

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:10.420
survival of the fittest works in, in a group of, well, in a group of chickens.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.020
We're humans, not chickens at all.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.880
How many times we got to do this?

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.260
Okay.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.840
But we haven't always been humans.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.300
We are humans now.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:23.140
Okay.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.320
So how did we, okay.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.820
I'm we're, we're going around in circles cause you don't like this question.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:36.660
Um, anyway, so back to the whole, a better society is taking care of the weak.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.740
I think it's interesting that Christian killing babies is okay.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:48.560
Vastly outnumber atheists, agnostics, Hindus, Buddhists in our adoptions, in

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.880
our building of hospitals, building of schools.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.200
I have literally no idea if that's true.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.020
I also don't care.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:57.700
Okay.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.740
You don't care probably because it is true.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.660
Well, I don't care because we don't have the statistics for it.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.180
And it's also irrelevant.

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:10.420
Oh, you get, well, I'm, I'm, I'm valent to do some homework here.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.020
By looking at these passages, you should look up which groups of Americans.

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.920
I said, I don't care because it's irrelevant.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.180
It doesn't matter if it's true.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.240
Why is it irrelevant?

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.260
You just told us what a good society looks like.

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.440
Cause it has nothing to do with whether or not Christianity is true.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.880
Christianity teaches that you shouldn't even have children.

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.540
Oh, this is going to be interesting.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:38.540
Christianity teaches that the end of the world is happening now and you

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.100
should do nothing but prepare for that.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.400
That's what Christianity teaches.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:50.960
So this idea that Christians do hospitals or Christians have bigger

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.380
families, these are not things that come from the Bible.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:58.560
What are you talking about, bro?

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.960
Jesus said to be, you should be a eunuch for the gospel.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.120
Paul says that you shouldn't even get married if you're single.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.120
It says, even if you are married, live like you're not.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.680
Yeah.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:12.330
You, you know that you're taking those horribly out of context.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:13.840
I'm not read them to you.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:16.330
Yes, please.

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:19.230
I'm look, I'm less ignorant in this area.

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:22.930
I'm, I'm assure you that you're just as ignorant in this area.

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:25.030
Matthew 19.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:27.010
We shall see.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.810
We certainly will.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:38.990
Matthew 19, as soon as he gets through with the nonsense about the divorce, he

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.870
is the case of a man with his wife.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:42.510
Is it better not to marry?

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:47.430
But he said to them, not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:51.450
whom it is given, for there are eunuchs who have been so for birth and there are

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:55.010
eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:59.450
made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, let anyone accept

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:10.790
this who can, if that's significantly different from Jesus saying you all

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:14.790
should be eunuchs and not get married.

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:16.450
Eunuchs.

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:17.330
Anyone.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:21.930
When he says anyone who accepts this, who's part of anyone?

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.640
Well, let's back up because it's talking about sexual purity.

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.420
When he says anyone who can accept it, who's, who's anyone?

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.980
Anyone who can accept it.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:41.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.020
Anyone.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:46.100
He said anyone who can accept it should do so.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.930
Yeah.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.810
Paul talks about the gift of singleness.

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:51.470
There you go.

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:53.050
Yeah, first truth in seven.

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.870
I know they're.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:54.810
Yep.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.670
Yeah.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:59:00.430
And so there are certain people who are not necessarily, are not highly

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:01.890
interested in getting married.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:04.750
And Paul says that that's advantageous.

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.210
Yeah.

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:09.630
If that there are pros and cons to be married and pros and cons of being single.

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.270
He says it's better to be single.

00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.990
Yeah.

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:15.150
If, yep.

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:20.910
He says it's better to be single, but it's, it's a, um, it's a gift.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.950
A gifting that's given by God to a very, very small number of people.

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:27.230
It didn't say very small later goes on this.

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.350
So, so Paul later, I mean, I know that you're.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.750
Warping this because Paul possibly in that same book talks about false

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:40.770
teachers and one of the ways to know if false teacher is that they forbid marriage.

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:43.790
Oh, that I'm not talking about forbidding marriage.

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.910
I'm saying what is better?

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:45.850
What is better?

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:48.150
Okay.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:54.950
In fact, in verse 38 in chapter seven, uh, he says, I mean, I'm going to put it

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:57.410
under a, sorry, I keep forgetting that you can't read my screen.

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:58.170
Everybody else can.

00:59:58.330 --> 00:59:59.670
First Corinthians seven 38.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:04.970
So, so then he, who marries his fiance does well and he, who refrains

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:06.390
from marriage will do better.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.140
First Corinthians seven.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:39.570
And it's well, this passage is definitely talking about just content in all forms.

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:43.730
Contentment in where you are in life.

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.910
When the Lord calls you that you don't need to be married, the more you, the

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.210
more you talk about the passage without reading it, the more I'm going to cook

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:52.250
you with it.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.480
I'm reading it right now.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.480
It says only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.980
him into which God has called.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.640
And this is my rule in all the churches was anyone at the time of this call

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.840
already circumcised, let not seek to remove the marks.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:11.340
He goes on, uh, down where he was called the Lord as a bond servant is a freed

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:11.960
man of the Lord.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.380
Likewise, he was free when called his sponsor of Christ, um, in whatever

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.360
condition each was called, let there, let him remain with God.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.660
Not concerning the betrothed.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.220
I have no command from the Lord, but I give judgment as one who by the

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.200
Lord's mercy is trustworthy.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:32.300
I think that in view of the present distress, it is good for a person

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.460
remain as he is.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.640
Are you bound to a wife?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.340
Do you, it's, it's very clear what the context is.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.480
He is not saying that we should all become single.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.240
He said it's better to be unmarried.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.120
Yeah.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.980
Because of the, this temporary, this short-term temporary distress that

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.220
had come upon the church, it was easier to be mobile.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.500
Your heart wasn't going to be broken.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.580
Um, the apostle Peter was married.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.240
Almost all of the apostles were married.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.140
Keep telling you, the more you talk about this passage without reading it,

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.180
the more I'm going to cook you.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.880
Go down to verse 31.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:07.440
Okay.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.240
And those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it for

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.400
the present form of this world is passing away.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.960
Paul is suggesting, yeah, Paul is suggesting that the reason why you

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.980
should remain unmarried is because the world is quickly about to end.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.760
The same thing he says in first lesson onions, chapter four, the same thing

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:34.220
Jesus says in Matthew 10, 23, Matthew 16, 27, 28 and Matthew 24, 29 through 34.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.280
He says for the present form of this world is passing away.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.020
I want you to be free from anxieties.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.760
The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.300
please the Lord, but the married man is anxious about worldly things,

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.280
how to please his wife and his interests are divided.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.540
That's why it's better to be unmarried.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.340
Yeah.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.180
So there you go.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.660
So Christianity teaches it's better to be a eunuch for the sake of the gospel

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.020
because the world's about to end.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.820
It's a doomsday cult, man.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.340
It's, it's speaking about a present distress.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.840
It doesn't say that.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.680
It says the present form of the world is about to end.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.980
As well as looking at the future.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:19.740
Yeah, I agree.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.300
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.260
It's, it's both the present thing and the future thing.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.480
No, no one's disagreeing that there aren't present struggles.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.420
We all agree on that.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:33.300
We know what was happening under, um, you know, Nero and then eventually

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.940
Caligula, so on and so forth.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.900
We know that they were under some stress, but Paul is very clear in

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.320
Corinthians and Thessalonians that the world's about to end and second

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.280
Peter says the same thing.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.280
And the Jewish world did pretty much end in just a few years.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.140
Doesn't say the Jewish world says the world.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:54.540
Okay.

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:01.370
The world that they were in ended.

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:02.850
He's not talking to Jews.

01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:06.790
He's talking to the Corinthian church and he didn't say the world of the Jews.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:07.630
He says the world.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:16.850
Well, you got me on that point.

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:23.830
So, so is it a bad thing to tell people to be single?

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.890
No, I think if you're a Christian, that's the preferred outcome.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:32.500
Yeah.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.320
If, if that's, if you can handle that.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.000
I agree.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.900
You can potentially, you can potentially, uh, win more souls to the eternal

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.500
kingdom that's not going to pass away.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:44.000
I agree.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.120
So the nonsense talking about, well, Christians have more babies

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.520
and they adopt more kids.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.560
It's all nonsense.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.980
That's not even part of Christianity.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.340
That's just something that religious people do more than non-religious people.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.760
It's not a Christian thing.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.900
It's a religious people thing because religious people have different

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.700
convictions and non-religious people.

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:16.430
Well, you got to interpret all things together in the scriptures.

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:21.630
Um, it's clear that the Lord has a high view of marriage in this life.

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:27.650
I still think that Paul is, is just talking about a present struggle that's

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:33.410
here and a huge upheaval in the world to come, and he's just simply talking about

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:37.730
the difficulty that there's going to be for a family man in this, if he's got to

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:39.870
try and care for his wife and children.

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:47.330
Um, it's very similar to when Jesus said, you know, blessed are those women who

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:54.070
don't have any children because of what's about to happen and the Jews definitely.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:55.770
They suffered.

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:57.650
Uh, they suffered big time there.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:01.670
And it probably, there were probably lots of women who wished that they had

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:07.530
never had the children that were going to be, um, killed at the hands of the Romans.

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.870
Yeah.

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:14.770
So, well, I mean, uh, since I got you on when miles will, um, end on my favorite

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.850
topic ever, do you mind if I picked the last topic?

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:19.050
Oh, sure.

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:22.930
I wouldn't make a claim and you're going to think I'm crazy.

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:25.210
And then I'm going to improve my claim to be true.

01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.310
Okay.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:31.850
I go for Jesus fulfilled precisely zero messianic prophecies.

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:39.790
Oh, okay.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:39.990
Yep.

01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.370
You're right.

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:41.330
I think you're crazy.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:42.990
There you go.

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.950
I already have one more fulfilled properties than Jesus.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.700
Oh yeah.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.120
I get it.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.240
All right.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.580
Want to see a case in point?

01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.880
Go for it.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.100
Turn in your Bible to Jeremiah 31 for me.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.240
We're going to go down to verses, uh, 15 through 17.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.880
Now, if you remember in Jeremiah, Jeremiah in chapter 25 has already

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.380
given the prophecy about how the Israelites are going to be taken captive

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.120
in the land of Babylon for 70 years.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.280
And then they're going to come back from the land of Babylon.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.520
Then they're going to be restored.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.860
We find a part of that prophecy in Jeremiah 31 says, thus say at the Lord

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.820
of voices heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.680
Rachel is weeping for her children.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:41.180
She refuses to be comforted for her children because they are no more.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.760
Thus say at the Lord, keep her voice from weeping and your eyes from tears for

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.120
there is a reward for your work, says the Lord, they shall come back from

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:49.940
the land of the enemy.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.280
There is hope for your future, says the Lord, your children shall

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.180
come back to their own country.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:56.980
Okay.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.960
Just on face value, what's happening here?

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.760
What are you talking about?

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.600
Um, I confess I wasn't paying too much attention to what you were reading.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:17.000
I was busy thinking about why that is not Herod killing, uh, the

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.800
children in Bethlehem.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.520
Yeah, go ahead.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.360
Uh, read, uh, 15 in your Bible.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.640
Read 15 through 17 for us.

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:28.270
And this says the Lord of voices heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping.

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:29.590
Rachel is weeping for her children.

01:08:29.650 --> 01:08:33.150
She refuses to be comforted for her children because they are no more.

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.990
This says the Lord, keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears.

01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:39.410
And there's a reward for your work declares the Lord nature, come back

01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:40.550
from the land of the enemy.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.230
There is hope for your future declares the Lord and your children shall

01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:45.670
come back to their own country.

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.630
So that prophecy happened.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:52.610
What, uh, where, where are you going with this?

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.030
It happened in five 39 BC.

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.950
Okay.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.410
Didn't happen during Jesus' time period.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.060
Okay.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.160
There's a prophecy about the children of Israel coming back from Babylon.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.100
Did the children of Israel come back from being murdered by Herod?

01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:19.990
Nope.

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.590
Right.

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.070
It says they're going to come back to their own country.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:25.570
It's clearly a prophecy about the children going captive in Babylon,

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:28.610
just like Jeremiah predicted about 15 times.

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:35.810
So why in the world, when I go to Matthew chapter two, it says that, uh, the

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.910
children were murdered in Bethlehem to fulfill the prophecy.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:40.670
And then it quotes this prophecy.

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:45.590
Why would I take that as being anything but like a crazy ass lie?

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:54.360
Um, well, if you, I'm not sure if you're being honest that you

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.620
don't know my perspective.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.180
I do know your perspective.

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.000
Okay.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:10.620
That is that what these prophets wrote was almost always a true immediate

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:11.880
situation.

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:13.620
It was at hand.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.400
Um, and then there was a double profit, a double fulfillment.

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:26.500
So in the case of David in Psalm 22, where he talks about being his hands

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:32.300
pierced, doesn't say pierced, um, uh, I'm pretty sure it says pierced.

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.420
Doesn't say pierced.

01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.070
It's not even a prophecy.

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.310
Oh, right.

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:42.950
It's not a prophecy, but I say, well, it is a prophecy.

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:43.810
It's a foretelling.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:44.670
Not a prophecy.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:50.170
The scriptures tell us that the, that all these prophets spoke about things that

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.970
they did not know what they were talking about.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:54.050
That's what the New Testament says.

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.950
I disagree with that.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.550
They were moved.

01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:56.430
Yep.

01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:59.130
They were moved by the Lord to speak things that they didn't understand.

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:02.190
And they went back to look and to try and understand what the prophecies

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:03.270
were that the Lord gave them.

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:04.250
And I disagree.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:08.670
Why would I believe that the prophets had two, why would I believe in dual fulfillment?

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:16.730
Um, because Christ is such a clear, I mean, he is the most bizarre coincidence

01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:22.210
imaginable, if there's not double fulfillment of these prophecies.

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:23.030
Oh, not even close.

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:25.890
In fact, I've constructed a whole list of double fulfillment

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.250
prophecies that are about me.

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:32.230
And in fact, I've constructed an entire list of double fulfillments and, um,

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:35.810
other fulfillments about my, uh, pet rock, uh, Doug.

01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:40.930
It turns out just finding random words on a page.

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:42.410
Does it make it a prophecy?

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:48.250
I have prophecy has to actually be like a clear form of speech where

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.830
God says X, Y, and Z is going to happen.

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:59.510
Um, okay.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.760
So what?

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:03.940
Yeah.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.360
So, okay.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.920
So you're setting up the criteria by which God makes prophecies.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.520
Well, God gave us the criteria in Deuteronomy 18.

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:13.680
Okay.

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:14.520
Right.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.080
Uh, God tells you in Deuteronomy-

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.800
If he says something that doesn't come to pass.

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:18.780
That's right.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.780
It's something that actually has to come to pass.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.420
That's testable, right?

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:28.400
It can't be a deep, dark hidden mystery that nobody even knows is a prophecy

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.580
because it's not couched as a prophecy.

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:34.650
Gotcha.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:40.610
So we have examples of prophecies being fulfilled immediately.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.070
Mm-hmm.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:47.010
That the people who heard them had no idea what was even being talked about.

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:52.990
When, uh, I think it was Elijah spoke from the Lord when they were

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:58.870
on besieged by the Babylonians that by this time tomorrow, when they were

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:02.330
starving bread is going to sell for like some really cheap rate.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:07.430
And it's a prediction that people are like, yeah, yep.

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:09.390
So, you know, it's a-

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:12.190
what he was talking about, but they knew it was a prediction.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:14.210
Okay.

01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:15.290
Right.

01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:15.690
Yeah.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:16.730
And we looking backwards.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.570
They didn't, they didn't understand it looking forward.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:21.130
They only understood it looking backwards.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:21.810
Oh, I disagree.

01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:23.350
And that's what we do.

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:25.350
No, I disagree entirely.

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.310
Is it by this time?

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:30.230
I'll just read it to you.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.550
Hold on.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:36.750
About this time tomorrow.

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:37.110
Sorry.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:40.590
Let me put it on the screen for everybody to read it about this time.

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.310
Tomorrow.

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:47.370
Uh, a say of the finest flower will sell for a Shekel, uh, and to say as of

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:49.790
barley for a Shekel at the gate of Samaria.

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:52.150
Now, this is a testable prediction.

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:55.310
All you have to do is say, shit, well, today's tomorrow.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:57.490
Did it come true?

01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.650
It's a prediction for the future.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:08.580
Okay.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.000
Gotcha.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:09.540
Right.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:14.700
So when, when we get to these, these, uh, non prophecies mentioned by the

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.340
new Testament about Jesus, I have no reason to believe that these are like

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:24.200
secret prophecies that were like hidden deep into the text somewhere that like

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.320
you didn't know they were a prophecy until someone came along and told you

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:35.800
about it later, can you think of even one prophecy where Jesus fulfilled the

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.260
original context of, and keep in mind that if you say Isaiah 53, I will cook

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:42.000
you on that just like I did everything else.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.020
I appreciate the forewarning.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.600
It's a promising.

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.040
Yes.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.040
Yes it is.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.920
Um, Isaiah let, let's go to Isaiah 53.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.820
They can't be three, five.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:00.340
They can never help themselves.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.860
They can never help themselves Mac every time.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.820
Too strong.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.080
All right.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.940
We'll get a little crack and go, thank God my son's asleep.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.180
I'm going to be tired tomorrow.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.380
He's going to wake up at like 7 a.m.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.780
They pay for this one.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.060
Yeah.

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.420
I got to be done after Joe.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.920
Uh, yeah, I'm definitely paying.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:19.500
Okay.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:20.320
All right.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.520
So Isaiah 53, right?

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.360
Well, I'm going to, I'm going to take you.

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.460
He was pierced for our transgressions.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.640
He was crushed for our iniquities.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.780
Do you know what context means?

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.900
I do know what context means.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:33.400
Good.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:33.860
Okay.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.120
Have you read all of Isaiah?

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.220
I have.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.620
Oh, it absolutely does.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:47.920
Oh, he does.

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:48.400
Oh, sure.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:48.740
Okay.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.260
But Israel, yeah, it absolutely does.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.400
It does tell you who the servant is.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:56.660
And this is again, this is a place where there is a, a double meaning.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.920
And it's very clear.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.560
I said original context.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.160
Can you find me a prophecy where he fulfilled the original context?

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.480
Not a double fulfillment.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.880
The original context of the prophecy.

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.080
I'm just talking about the meaning of the text.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:11.740
No, no, no.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.420
I'm talking about the original context of the prediction, not about a secondary meaning.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:18.320
Okay.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.880
Is there one prophecy in the Bible where he fulfilled the original context of the

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.240
prophecy?

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.040
Yes.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:27.780
All right.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.080
Where is it?

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.160
So Isaiah 53, Isaiah 53.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.200
You said it was a dual fulfillment.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:34.630
Okay.

01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:40.630
So I was, I was, I've heard this before where I start reading this and it's about

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:41.670
the servant of Jehovah.

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.230
And you say, Oh, but it says that Israel is the servant of Jehovah.

01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:48.030
You said it was a dual fulfillment, not me.

01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:52.110
You said it, which means if it's a dual fulfillment, that means the original

01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:53.610
fulfillment isn't in Jesus.

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:55.890
The secondary fulfillment is in Jesus.

01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.610
Okay.

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:02.370
So this is a prime, this is a, Christ is the primary fulfillment of this.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:03.790
Okay.

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:05.410
So Israel is a secondary fulfillment.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:15.520
Um, so when you say primary and secondary, I don't mean, no, no.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.960
Israel, Israel is not the Israel is not a primary or a secondary

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.480
fulfillment of Isaiah 53.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.140
It's not talking about Israel.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:22.500
Okay.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.780
Well, let's read some passages.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.180
All right.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.040
Uh, turn to Isaiah 41, starting in Isaiah 52, starting in Isaiah 52.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.760
You're going to need to go back further than 52.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.820
Go to Isaiah 41, eight through nine.

01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:38.230
So, yeah.

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:40.790
I'll just keep it in mind.

01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:41.510
One through nine.

01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:46.410
Keep in mind, I prophesied all of this at the end of this discussion.

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:51.670
Remember I predicted all of this and also fair warning, I've had this

01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:57.450
discussion a hundred times, so you're not going to say anything I've never heard.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:00.630
Not a single word out of your mouth will be something I've never heard before.

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:02.210
Okay.

01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:05.810
I know that when I talk to apologists, they always think that they're going to

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.510
be the ones to say something original.

01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:09.110
You're not, you're not going to be original.

01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:12.330
You're going to say every talking point that I know you're about to say.

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:17.730
Isaiah 41, eight through nine, he says, but you Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom

01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:21.550
I've chosen the offspring of Abraham, my friend, you, who I took from the

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:25.330
furthest ends of the earth and called from its furthest corners, saying to you

01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:28.330
that you are my servant, I have chosen you not cast you off.

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:28.910
Okay.

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:40.430
Um, the servant is Jacob.

01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.470
Fantastic.

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:42.030
Okay.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:47.610
Isaiah 43, 10, he says, you're my witnesses, says the Lord and my

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:52.230
servant, whom I have chosen so that you may know and believe in me and

01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:55.070
understand that I am he who's a servant.

01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:59.860
And Isaiah 43, let's see.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.440
Probably also Israel.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:01.740
Let's see.

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.540
He reformed your Israel.

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.640
So we haven't chosen it.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:06.480
You mean don't believe me.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:15.660
It's Israel because he says, you're my, yeah, the beginning, he says,

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.800
he who created you, oh, Jacob.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.340
So I'm assuming it's still talking to Jacob.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.520
Jacob is Israel.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:22.280
Right.

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:22.760
Yep.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:23.160
Right.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:23.600
Okay.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.020
Fantastic.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.480
Jacob is, yeah, Isaiah 43, Israel.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:26.740
Okay.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.780
Isaiah 41, one through two, but here now, oh, Jacob, my servant and Israel,

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.720
whom I have chosen, thus saith the Lord who made you, who formed you in the womb

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.160
and will help you do not fear.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.580
Oh, Jacob, my servant.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.400
Who's a servant in 44.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.740
Wait, what, what chapter are you on?

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.180
Uh, 44, one and two.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.460
Oh, 44.

01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:54.850
44, one, two, Jacob, my servant, Israel, whom I've chosen.

01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.570
This is the Lord.

01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.510
Yep.

01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:57.450
It's Jacob again.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:57.830
Cool.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:58.590
All right.

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:07.530
I formed you, you are my servant.

01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:08.950
Oh, Israel, do not forget me.

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:10.610
And so who's a servant here?

01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:14.710
That is again, oh, Jacob and Israel.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:15.870
I'm seeing a pattern.

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:20.890
Isaiah 45, four for the sake of my servant, Jacob and Israel, my chosen.

01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:22.430
I call you by your name.

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:26.150
And again, who's the servant here?

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.800
That is, is, is, is, is, is Jacob.

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.880
Last one.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.880
Now we're getting to the crescendo of the prophecy.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.180
He says, go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.120
shout of joy, right?

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.980
Oh, Isaiah 43.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:43.520
I'm sorry.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:43.980
48.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:44.720
Okay.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:45.590
48, 20.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.060
Well, 43, 48.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:48.880
Uh, I'm sorry.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.660
Uh, 48, 20.

01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:53.610
All right.

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:54.490
I'm good.

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:59.690
Says go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declared this with a shout of

01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:04.810
proclaim it, send it forth to the ends of the earth, say the Lord has

01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:06.450
redeemed his servant, Jacob.

01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:11.470
So we're getting towards the crescendo of second Isaiah, which is God freeing

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:13.370
his people from the Babylonian captivity.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:19.150
And he says, Hey, go out from Babylon, flee from captivity because the Lord

01:21:19.150 --> 01:21:20.690
has redeemed his servant, Jacob.

01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:25.850
So again, in 48, it really seems like this prophecy given in second

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:27.630
Isaiah is about Israel, is it not?

01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:30.910
Well, yes.

01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:35.470
Um, I would say pay very close attention in that last verse you just read and

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:39.470
see who it was who redeemed his servant, Jacob.

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.370
Obviously it's Yahweh.

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:45.570
Yahweh is the one who comes with a mighty stretched out arm who releases

01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:47.550
them from the Babylonian captivity.

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:51.270
And who does he use to accomplish this person?

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:56.050
What's, what's the name of the Messiah that accomplishes God's will in Isaiah?

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:03.310
Um, is this going to, is this a reference to Cyrus?

01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:04.130
You got it.

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:04.410
Yeah.

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:09.890
King Cyrus is the Mashiach who God says I have taken by the right hand.

01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:13.410
He is the one who's going to free my people and rebuild my city.

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:15.070
Okay.

01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:15.770
Right.

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:17.390
It doesn't say anything about Jesus.

01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:20.110
Jesus has nothing to do with this, right?

01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:26.530
The suffering servant is the righteous remnant of Israel who had to pay for not

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:30.490
only the sins of the wicked people of Israel, but also the other nations who

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:36.910
took them captive, which is why in chapter 52, you have this narrative leading

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:43.950
down to the nations getting ready to speak in chapter 52, we have the

01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:46.770
preparations of the exile and pull it up.

01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:48.090
I'll put it on the screen.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:53.650
Starting in verse 10 says the Lord has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all

01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:58.470
the nations and all the ends of their earth sow seed, the salvation of our God.

01:22:58.970 --> 01:23:03.250
Now this has been repeated like 10 or 15 times in second Isaiah already.

01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:09.030
God has told you that he's revealing his outstretched arm, his mighty hand to

01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:13.830
free the Israelites from the Babylonian captivity, which is why the next verse

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:18.330
says depart, depart, go out from there, touch no unclean thing, go out from the

01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:19.770
midst of it and purify yourselves.

01:23:19.770 --> 01:23:25.590
So in 52, he's suggesting that showing up with his mighty arm before all the

01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:30.030
nations is in fact freeing the Israelites from captivity, correct?

01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:33.730
No, that sounds right.

01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:34.470
Okay.

01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:40.250
Now he goes on and in 52, it gets to the part that you're interested in.

01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:42.170
It says, see, my servant shall prosper.

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:43.690
He shall be exhausted and lifted up.

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:44.750
He shall be very high.

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:47.590
Just as there were many who were astonished at him.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:51.710
So Mard was his appearance beyond human semblance and form beyond, beyond that

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:56.310
of mortals, so he shall startle many nations and kings will shut their mouths

01:23:56.310 --> 01:24:00.410
because of them for that which had not been told of them, they shall see that

01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:02.330
which they had not heard they shall contemplate.

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:07.170
Why would I read this and think that this is about anybody except for

01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:09.650
Israel, uh, before all the nations?

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:29.320
Yep.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.180
I, I agree with you that that definitely, it all looks like Israel.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:33.600
Right.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.300
So the nations.

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:34.720
Great.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.000
Okay.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.920
So I'm with you there.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.300
So we've got the Israel before the nations.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:45.420
And the last thing that is said is that of the nations that would, which had not

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.800
been told to them, they will see because they don't have the prophets and that

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.900
which they have not heard, they will contemplate again, because they're not

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.240
part of Israelite, uh, congregation.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.960
So they're going to contemplate this thing that they're about to witness,

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.640
namely the freeing of the Israelites.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.200
Right.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.020
Is a picture of the Israelites contemplating the thing that they have

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.320
just witnessed says who has believed our report and to whom has the

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.640
arm of the Lord been revealed?

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.680
Well, this is clearly a callback to the prior chapter where it says the arm of

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.120
the Lord was revealed to the nations.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:19.600
Right.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.920
So now we've got a personification of the nations saying, holy shit, who is,

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.940
who would believe what we've just witnessed?

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.940
Like who would believe this thing?

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.240
This nation that came in where they were downtrodden, we thought they were

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.820
accursed by God, they came in, they got rescued, they got freed, they got

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.020
delivered, who would believe this thing?

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.960
This is a personification of the nations saying, holy shit, did

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.180
you see what just happened?

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:48.290
Okay.

01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:48.950
Right.

01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:55.690
So the whole chapter in Isaiah 53 are the nations that had once abused

01:25:55.690 --> 01:26:02.250
Israel, coming to terms with the fact that Israel wasn't a forsaken people.

01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:06.830
They were in fact, God's holy people and we abused them.

01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:10.290
We inflicted pain upon this people.

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:12.990
And in fact, a number of these people were righteous.

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:18.110
In fact, that's why Isaiah 53 talks about how some of them were even,

01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:25.030
uh, akin to being a sacrifice for sin, because now that these Israelites are

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:29.230
here and we've abused them so badly, but these were God's people, God's

01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:33.690
righteous people, um, the fact that we're now recognizing that Yahweh is

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:38.930
the one true Lord is, is a beautiful metaphor for how they literally died

01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:43.310
for us, they literally died so that we can see that Yahweh is the one true

01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:48.590
God, which is predicted like 10 times in second Isaiah, like 10 different

01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:54.110
times, the prophet tells you that I'm going to vindicate myself when I

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.830
glorify the nation of Israel.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:00.600
You know what I mean?

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:01.340
Okay.

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:09.900
So just help me, help me keep up here in, in verse 13 of chapter 52, who, who

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.080
is speaking here, according to what you're just saying, behold, my servant

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:13.660
shall act wisely.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.640
Who is that speaking?

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.380
53, you mean?

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.560
No, 52, 13.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.300
Oh, sorry, sorry, 52, 13 is the righteous remnant.

01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:28.350
No, where it says, behold, my servant shall act wisely.

01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:31.050
Who, who is speaking there?

01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:32.690
That's the righteous remnant.

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:33.830
Oh, who's speaking?

01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:34.550
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.750
Sorry.

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:35.450
I apologize.

01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:39.630
Uh, the person speaking is, is this is a prophecy being delivered

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:43.670
theoretically through Isaiah or somebody from Isaiah's school, right?

01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:48.350
So the servant is Isaiah referring to the nation of Israel, although

01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:49.710
from the mouthpiece of God.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:56.840
Okay.

01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.300
Right.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:05.360
So here, here's what I think your first inclination about

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.760
Isaiah 53 was right.

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:11.160
Isaiah 53 is primarily about the nation of Israel.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.320
If it's about Jesus, then it's just a secondary fulfillment.

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:16.900
It can't be the original context.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.860
The original context of a second Isaiah is all about the nation of Israel.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.480
In fact, most academic resources will just tell you this outright that

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.120
Isaiah 53 is about the nation of Israel.

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.800
And they'll even tell you that if it's about Jesus, it's because they'll look

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.480
at this secondary fulfillment based on these, uh, really interesting parallels.

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:44.320
All right.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.800
So, so down in verse in Isaiah 53, right?

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:49.920
Who were you proposing?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.660
Uh, 53 verse three.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:57.960
Oh, what about when it says, when it says, and as one from whom men hid their

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:01.540
faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:07.280
Who is the, we, who's the, we esteemed him not the nations, the nations.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:07.840
Okay.

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.920
Namely Babylon, where is the, where is the transfer from God's speaking about

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:19.160
my servant shall act wisely to then it's the nations talking.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.360
I'll show you is at the end of 52, go to the last verse in 52.

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.280
And so he shall sprinkle many nations.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.920
King shall shut their mouths because of him for that which was not told had not

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.900
been told them they see and that which they have not heard, they understand.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.860
And then who has believed what he has heard from us.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:39.380
Right.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:42.500
So you're saying this is the, this is beginning where the nations are speaking.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:43.520
Right.

01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:48.240
So at the very end of chapter 52, 15, it says that which they had not

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.540
heard, they shall contemplate.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.760
So there's a prediction saying that they shall contemplate the thing.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.860
And then the very next verse is a depiction of those nations

01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:59.340
contemplating the thing.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.080
Okay.

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:02.020
Right.

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.760
Well, before he went on planet like a road, after I browned, he had the

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.340
full majesty that we should look at him and beauty that we should desire him.

01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:14.440
He was despised and rejected by men, a man of stars and acquainted with grief.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:20.240
And as one from whom men hid their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.920
So the nations despised Israel and did not esteem him.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:30.880
And then surely he, Israel, you would say bore our griefs.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.240
So Israel bore the griefs of the nations and carried their

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.040
sorrows is how you read this.

01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:42.280
Well, the righteous remnant specifically, and Jeremiah clears this up a little

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:47.620
bit where he likens the righteous remnant of Israel's suffering and the Babylon

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:55.920
in captivity, um, as being like a necessary condition, um, even though

01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:01.340
they're technically in captivity for the sins of the unrighteous, uh, Israelites.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:02.640
Right.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.420
You say we have to suffer alongside of the rest of the Israelites.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:06.960
Right.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:10.840
Okay.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.380
So continuing on this being the nation speaking, surely he's born our

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.580
griefs and carried our sorrows.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:21.160
Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God and afflicted, but he was

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.300
pierced for our transgressions.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.380
He was crushed for our iniquities.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:30.180
Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace.

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:32.880
And with his wounds, we are healed.

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:36.180
You're still saying that's the nations talking about Israel.

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:36.500
Yeah.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.500
It's beautiful too.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:41.060
Okay.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:45.300
And then the nations are saying, is this still the nations or is this shift in

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:49.460
verse six, I don't think the nation stopped speaking to like verse 10.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.020
Okay.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.540
All we like sheep have gone astray.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.280
We have turned everyone to his own way.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.300
And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:07.800
So the Lord laid on Israel, the iniquity of the nations around them.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.660
Yeah, that's what you're saying.

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.040
That's the beauty of the passage.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.140
He was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.680
Uh, Israel definitely opens mouth anyway, like a lamb has led to the

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.580
slaughter and like a sheep that before it shears a silence.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.200
So he opened not his mouth.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.320
My oppression and judgment, he was taken away and as for his generation, who

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.200
considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.200
the transgression of my people.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.840
So who's the my there?

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.320
Well, it's the speaker that's personifying the nations.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.140
Um, well, it changes.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:55.240
It changes from we to my, so, so that's third person to first person.

01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.260
There's a shift here.

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.620
So that happens a lot in Isaiah.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:32:59.600
Okay.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.820
That's not nothing, nothing to see her folks.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:02.960
Nothing to see here.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.240
Stricken for the transgression of my people.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:10.620
And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death.

01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:14.040
So we've got a rich man singular.

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:18.880
They made his, they made all of Israel's grave with a rich man.

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:25.360
Although, although he had done no violence and yet, so Isaiah is all

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.840
about the violence that was taking place in Israel.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.800
And here it says that he had done no violence.

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.100
They're not in Israel.

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.100
And I addressed this already.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.880
This is about the righteous remnant, right?

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.440
The righteous remnant were the ones suffering alongside of

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.560
the unrighteous Israelites.

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:47.770
That's why it says in chapter 40, verse one and two, that they've

01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:49.890
received double for their sins.

01:33:50.490 --> 01:33:54.510
They've received one lot for the sinful ways of Israel.

01:33:54.790 --> 01:34:00.370
They've reserved a second lot or they've been given a second lot for the

01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:02.690
captivity and the sins of the nations.

01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:05.110
They're not just there paying for their own sins.

01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:09.110
They're there to pay for the sins of themselves and for the nation.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:12.340
Okay.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:13.280
Right.

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.400
And there was no deceit in his mouth yet.

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.560
It was the will of the Lord to crush him.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:24.360
He was put to grief when his soul makes an offering for guilt.

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.740
He shall see his offspring.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:28.540
He shall prolong his days.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.960
The will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.080
Out of the anguish of his soul, he shall see and be satisfied.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.260
By his knowledge, shall the righteous one, my servant, make many

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:43.700
to be accounted of righteous.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.020
So who is this his knowledge?

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.600
Why is there a distinction here in verse 11?

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.480
Because my servant is God's servant, the nation of Israel.

01:34:54.740 --> 01:35:00.100
That's why I said the tone or the person speaking shifts in verse 10.

01:35:02.770 --> 01:35:14.680
In verse 10, I'm sorry, verse 11, verse 11.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.320
I apologize.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:17.960
And he shall bear their inequities.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:24.040
Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many and he shall divide the

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:29.840
spoil with the strong because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.640
with the transgressors, yet he bore the sin of many and makes intercession for

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:35.780
the transgressors.

01:35:37.290 --> 01:35:42.630
So, so you just, you just do not see Jesus in this passage.

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.950
No, I see the nation of Israel.

01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:48.190
You only see Jesus because the New Testament tells you it's about Jesus.

01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:52.410
I see the nation of Israel because I've read the Old Testament intently many

01:35:52.410 --> 01:35:56.870
times and the Old Testament tells you on multiple occasions that after the

01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:59.090
Babylonian exile, God is going to restore Israel.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:04.950
And when he restores Israel, he's going to glorify himself through Israel.

01:36:14.370 --> 01:36:22.690
Well, he's, uh, if, if Israel, if this is all speaking about Israel, then maybe

01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:28.970
I ought to worship Israel because Israel is able to redeem and able to account

01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:34.030
righteous, able to bear iniquities of other people and put them away, able to

01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:38.630
um, bear the sin of many, make intercession.

01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:43.570
And then even after Israel has perished, they're still able to make intercession

01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:46.790
for the transgressors and divide a portion with the many.

01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:51.850
Yeah, because the nation of Israel is divine here.

01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:54.290
Yeah, because they're certainly not divine.

01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:56.610
God is the one who sent them there, right?

01:36:56.890 --> 01:37:00.950
But the, the reason why they're able to have offspring and divide the

01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:06.070
spoils with the strong is because they're a nation and not a dead individual.

01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:07.210
Right.

01:37:07.210 --> 01:37:11.310
Uh, they have offspring because they survived the captivity.

01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:18.390
You broke up right before you said they have offspring before they, um.

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.750
Right.

01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:20.690
So they have offspring.

01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:25.710
They have offspring because they survived the captivity.

01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:29.030
Jesus didn't have any offspring.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.440
Oh, he has lots of offspring.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:33.320
Zero.

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.400
He's got heirs.

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:38.420
He's our, uh, siblings according to New Testament.

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:46.700
Wow.

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.740
Well, this has been really cool.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:49.240
Yeah.

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.220
Listen, Joe, I appreciate you coming up and having a decent conversation with me.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.860
I know these are difficult topics and a lot of, a lot of people get up here and

01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.240
they get a little bit hostile, but you haven't got hostile.

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:00.760
You've been pretty courteous the whole time.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.420
So big W.

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:04.680
Yeah, man.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.480
I, uh, I can say in all sincerity, I love you and I want you to

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.720
inherit eternal life with me.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:18.380
I want you to inherit eternal life too, which is why I want you to turn to Doug.

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:23.700
Well, Doug has not done for me what Jesus has done for me.

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:34.520
So until Doug can transform me overnight from a self-centered monster into someone

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.700
who actually cares about other people and righteousness, I'm sticking with Jesus.

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:39.340
All right.

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.180
Well, you take Jesus.

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.700
I'll take the placebo effect and we'll meet in the middle.

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.500
Well, may God bless you with his salvation.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:49.740
All right.

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.320
Have a good one, Joe.
