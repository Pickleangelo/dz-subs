WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
SPEAKER_2: How are you doing, Hadassah?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.120
SPEAKER_1: Very well.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.980
How are you?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.240
SPEAKER_2: Doing very well.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.080
Thank you for asking.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.960
Hadassah, are you at least 18 and are you a believer?

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.240
SPEAKER_1: Yes and yes.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.140
I'm 42 actually.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.340
SPEAKER_2: And you believe in some kind of a god?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.460
In Jesus, yes.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.060
Cool.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.620
What would be the best evidence or the best argument for the Christian god being real?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.570
SPEAKER_1: The best evidence would be the believers.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.810
SPEAKER_2: Tell me how because the New Testament says that the believers are going to behave a particular

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.990
way and that we should know, Christians should be different from non-Christians but I don't

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.810
see much of a difference.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.640
Well, it's been 2,000 years.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.560
A lot happens in 2,000 years.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.580
So?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.160
I mean, are you aware of the end times theology at all?

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.140
I'm quite aware but that doesn't actually address what I was saying.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.200
The New Testament says that Christians are going to behave a particular way, right?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.780
Do you believe that the Holy Spirit makes people a new creature?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.940
SPEAKER_1: I do.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.260
SPEAKER_2: Do you think that people that are new creatures in Christ are going to behave the same as

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.060
non-Christians?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.360
No, they're not.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.240
Okay.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.940
So they are going to behave slightly differently.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.400
Okay.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.760
And what sort of behaviors would I expect from Christianity that I wouldn't expect from

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.060
non-Christians?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.100
SPEAKER_1: Humility for one and that's a big one.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.840
SPEAKER_2: Okay.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.560
Hold on.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.640
Let me mark this down real quick.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.820
I want to make sure I don't want to forget these bullet points.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.520
So, number one, Christians should have humility.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.040
Okay.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.720
Anything else?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.900
What else?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.200
SPEAKER_1: I mean, right now, that's the one that can't be mimicked as well as the others.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.440
SPEAKER_2: Sure.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.680
Yeah.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.380
But what are the others?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.550
I mean, let's see.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.590
SPEAKER_1: I mean, in this day and age, like I say, most things can be mimicked.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.690
Most people know the gospel knowledge to the degree that they know it.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.430
And they like it, you know, everybody agrees that it's peaceful, X, Y, Z, blah, blah,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.650
blah.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.350
SPEAKER_2: Right.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.670
So what other characteristics would I expect from the Christians?

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.510
SPEAKER_1: You're going to expect them to make better decisions.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.830
Like how so?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.470
SPEAKER_2: Quicker.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.230
Oh, like they're going to be smarter.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.610
They're going to have wisdom because they have chosen to use a map rather than navigate

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.270
SPEAKER_1: their own way.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.750
SPEAKER_2: Okay.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.070
So Christians should be more intelligent than non-Christians?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.950
They are more intelligent than non-Christians.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.550
They are.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.050
Okay.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390
So just make sure we're checking this off.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.090
So point number one, Christians are going to be humble.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.790
Point number two, they're going to be smarter than Christians or non-Christians.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.210
Right.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.090
Okay.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.790
Anything else?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.580
I don't know.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.000
I mean, what else is there?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.540
You know the rest of it.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.660
I'm asking you.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:22.200
SPEAKER_1: I'm trying to pick things that wouldn't normally be noticed because you seem lost particularly

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.720
SPEAKER_2: about it.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.560
I mean, you could just tell me what the Bible says.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.780
What does the Bible say Christians are going to be like?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.340
Is that because that's the only text that you know?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.680
So we should stick to the text?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.600
Why don't you tell them?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.000
You can make stuff up if you want.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.780
Listen, if you think there are other characteristics.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.680
SPEAKER_1: I might be able to.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.960
Would you be able to hang with the argument if I made stuff up right now?

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.020
SPEAKER_2: Probably not.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.340
I'm certain I can hang with any argument that you lay out.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.120
SPEAKER_1: Okay.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.320
SPEAKER_2: Hadassah, remember, you're supposed to be humble.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.340
So don't.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.720
SPEAKER_1: Yeah.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.220
Don't.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.300
Okay.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.540
Don't.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.260
I can see through you.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.600
Hadassah.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.640
So no, you're not going to use that shit as a leash.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.040
SPEAKER_2: You gaslighting asshole.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.860
Don't counteract.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.780
Oh, there it is.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.380
SPEAKER_1: Okay.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.260
Don't what?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.100
There it is what?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.940
Point number one.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.840
Calling you out.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.860
Point number one.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.600
Point number one.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600
Point number one is humility.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.840
SPEAKER_2: Humility.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.540
SPEAKER_1: Humility.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.700
Do you have humility?

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.680
SPEAKER_2: See, you wouldn't know humility with both your hands, bro.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.340
SPEAKER_1: That's what you said.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.400
You don't know it.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.280
Do you know what humility means?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.380
You don't know what humility...

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.160
No, you don't know what it is.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.180
It's crazy that...

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.600
You don't know what it is.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.400
SPEAKER_2: It's crazy that we started this conversation by me simply asking you a few questions.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.940
SPEAKER_1: Yeah, and you and your fake ass...

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.700
SPEAKER_2: We started this conversation by me merely just asking you a couple questions.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.320
SPEAKER_1: And I always get muted.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.860
SPEAKER_2: We started the conversation by just asking a couple simple questions.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.660
I haven't even engaged in any argumentation yet, and you're already upset calling me an

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.160
asshole.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.880
Did I say something to you?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.960
Yes, you did.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.620
What did I say?

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.940
You're full of shit.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.620
What did I say to you?

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.640
Everyone here knows it and feels it, and you're acting like an asshole.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.800
I don't care about your stupid trophies.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.020
SPEAKER_1: I know better than that.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.840
There's that humility and love of Christ.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.040
SPEAKER_2: I know better.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.140
SPEAKER_1: Yeah, this is the love of Christ right here.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.620
Do you know what the Dunning-

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.780
How would you know?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.000
How would you know?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.500
SPEAKER_2: Do you know what the Dunning-Kruger effect is?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.540
SPEAKER_1: Yeah, it's some shit that used to be called something else, and then they named it after

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.600
some dude...

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.680
I'm old enough to remember when they just fucking called it whatever the fuck they called

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.920
it, common sense or whatever the fuck.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.400
SPEAKER_2: What is it?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.400
What's the Dunning-Kruger effect?

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.820
SPEAKER_1: Just give it to me, my guy.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.560
You said you know what it is.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.320
I don't sit in front of Google memorizing the definitions of things so people think

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.780
I'm smart.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.260
So why don't you give us that?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:02.560
SPEAKER_2: Well, first of all, you said-

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.200
If you don't know what it is, you should have said that you don't know what it is because

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.640
that would mean-

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.300
That's what you think smartness is?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.980
So that means you would actually be humble, right?

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.980
You said Christians are going to be more humble than non-Christians, which means if you're

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.860
being humble, humble people don't claim to know things that they don't actually know.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.640
So what we've discovered so far is that you're not humble.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.500
You're a phony.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.260
Because you said that you knew what the Dunning-Kruger effect is, but now you're telling me that

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.160
you don't actually know what the Dunning-Kruger effect is.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.520
So-

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.540
SPEAKER_1: I do.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.480
You know what it is.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.240
SPEAKER_2: Okay.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.780
Okay.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.340
What is it?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.820
Tell me then.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.160
I've heard of it.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.540
What is it?

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.220
Is that supposed to prove whether I know what it is or not?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.660
Yeah.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.640
If you say you know what something is-

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.380
I'm 42 years old, bro.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.760
I got a master's degree.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.920
I got a lot of shit in here.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.720
SPEAKER_1: I'm sure you do.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.700
So just save us some time, my guy.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.080
So you should be able to-

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.620
Why don't you graciously save us some time?

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.380
SPEAKER_2: So you should be able to tell me what the Dunning-Kruger effect is.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.300
SPEAKER_1: Graciously save us some time.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.600
I know you're looking right at it, so why don't you graciously save us some time?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.780
SPEAKER_2: I'm waiting for you to save time because you said you already know what it is.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.300
I do know what it is.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.540
Sure.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.000
Then what is it?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.580
I've watched YouTube before.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.360
I looked at it.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.660
SPEAKER_1: I did that of my own volition.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.920
I didn't hear about it and then said, oh, I better make sure I know about it.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.560
So what is it?

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.300
I actually was interested in that shit.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:47.480
SPEAKER_2: I don't know what it is, but I do know what it is, so why don't you graciously save us

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.820
some time?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.400
I did that of my own volition.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.020
I did that of my own volition.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.140
SPEAKER_1: I did that of my own volition.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.860
SPEAKER_2: You didn't look it up, so you don't know what the Dunning-Kruger effect is.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.820
SPEAKER_1: My guy, my guy.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.140
It's just one of many things to know that we could Google.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.880
You could be Googling it right now.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.780
SPEAKER_2: You're just trying to make me look weird.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.380
I'm making myself look weird.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.940
Just save your time and look the fuck up.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.640
If you don't know what it is, you should've said you don't know.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.080
I know what the Dunning-Kruger effect is.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.380
SPEAKER_1: I'm 42 years old.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.220
I pick and choose what shit I need to save in my brain.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.380
SPEAKER_2: I just remember the conclusion.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.100
I remember the conclusion I drew about it,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.240
which is what the fuck?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.820
SPEAKER_1: Why are they trying to name old shit after some guy

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.880
and make it seem like it's some new ass information?

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.280
SPEAKER_2: That's not at all what it sounds.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.180
I just, that's, I just, that's what I remember

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.440
reacting about it when I heard about it.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.780
Do you even know what the principle

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.120
of the Dunning-Kruger effect is?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.980
Just fucking tell us, bro.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.960
It's just a Google.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.100
It's just two sentences, tops.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.880
You're a prophet.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.880
All you have to do is ask your god.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.820
Refresh my memory.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.460
No, that's not how it works, bro.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.300
SPEAKER_1: Do you know or do you, do you know or not?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.400
I don't remember.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.000
How about that?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.800
SPEAKER_2: So then you don't know.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.920
You should have said you don't know.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.520
SPEAKER_1: That wouldn't be true.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.480
That would be a lie.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.180
SPEAKER_2: It would be a lie.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.260
You haven't demonstrated that so far, though.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.940
What you've demonstrated is that you're a liar.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.320
Because you haven't moved the conversation on.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.580
So the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.340
SPEAKER_1: I think people can tell who's the,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.260
who the dumbass is and who isn't.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.200
SPEAKER_2: Yeah, you got that right.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.140
The people can certainly tell.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.000
Because I'm pissed off and I'm still,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.180
SPEAKER_1: I'm still dominating.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.040
SPEAKER_2: I know you are so pissed right now.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.900
SPEAKER_1: So the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.980
Yeah, I am pissed and I'm still dominating.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.780
SPEAKER_2: Not even close.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.760
So the Dunning-Kruger. Continue.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.960
So the Dunning-Kruger effect is something

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.060
that we find in psychology where people

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.680
that are the least equipped and the least educated

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.780
and the least knowledgeable in particular subjects

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.280
actually believe that they're more knowledgeable,

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.200
more capable when it's actually not true.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.940
Because as it turns out, the people who know the least

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.440
or more likely to believe that they know

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.940
more than they actually know,

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.700
because they're not actually aware

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.340
of the things that they don't know.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.860
They're so delightfully unaware of what they don't know

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.900
that they think because they've learned a couple things

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.120
that they actually know a lot.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.640
When in reality, the people who do get PhDs,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.320
the people who do learn a lot,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.460
the people that do excel greatly

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.940
actually start to underestimate how much they know.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.480
It's a really fun thing that happens in psychology.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.920
So when people come up here

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.740
and they claim to know a whole lot,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.880
and I sense that maybe they don't,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.940
I just ask them simple questions to find out

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.480
if they know as much as they claim,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.360
which is why I'm asking you questions.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.980
I want to test you.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.340
You're claiming that you're really smart.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.900
I just wanna know if you are.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.820
Okay, well, you could have just asked me

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.480
SPEAKER_1: what my credentials are.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.520
Sure, what are your credentials?

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.520
Masters, excuse me, I have a master's degree in English.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.320
SPEAKER_2: And what are you laughing about?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.380
You got a master's degree in English?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.620
You might as well have done underwater basket weaving.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.740
No, we're talking, this was 20 years ago.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.280
This was when degrees were actually very good still.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.800
SPEAKER_1: This was while the internet was being born at the same time.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.160
SPEAKER_2: Oh boy, and what do you do

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.000
with your master's degree in English?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.860
I'm a writer.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.300
That makes a lot of sense.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.960
Among other things.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.080
Sure, does your master's degree in English

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.000
equip you to be an expert in things that are not English?

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.760
Absolutely, it does.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.260
Like what?

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.080
Let me tell you how.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.600
SPEAKER_1: I just asked you what.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.240
SPEAKER_2: When you get, okay, that's because that's what you think

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.280
that's gonna answer your question or something.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.040
Hadasa, I know how learning works.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.360
SPEAKER_1: Excuse me.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.500
Hadasa, I know how learning works.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.700
Okay, okay, really?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.320
Okay, well.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.360
I'm just asking.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.440
Let me tell you how.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.220
What other fields of.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.860
SPEAKER_2: When you're in the humanities,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.860
and I tell you, when you get a degree in the.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.000
So just cool your memories for a minute.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.340
I'm just asking you what other fields of study

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.020
does getting a master's in English prepare you for?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.320
SPEAKER_1: It prepares you for quite a bit.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.680
Like what?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.240
You learn how to express your ideas

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.040
and have a conversation like we're doing now.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.760
I don't think we're having a conversation.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.380
So I've been more skilled for many decades.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.380
Oh, I know you don't because I am dominating you

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.060
with my pinky and it's uncomfortable for you.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.320
SPEAKER_2: Again, you're just demonstrating

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.740
that you're falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.840
SPEAKER_1: This is not.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.860
No, you're falling.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.640
SPEAKER_2: Excuse me, did you know that I had a master's.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.020
Hadassah, just remember that as a Christian,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.300
you're supposed to be humble

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.140
and you're not being humble right now.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.960
I'm waiting for the humility

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.620
because you're proving your claims to be false.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.060
Imagine being a prophet of God.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.580
SPEAKER_1: Does it look like that whip works on me, my dude?

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:13.980
It does.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.700
SPEAKER_2: Hadassah, you know.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.080
You can put that whip away.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.220
SPEAKER_1: Hadassah. Put your whip away.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.580
You know.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.580
It doesn't work on me.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.240
Did you know that I.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.020
It doesn't work on me.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.640
SPEAKER_2: I have a master's degree too.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.100
I don't care.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.620
You're the one being an asshole.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.200
SPEAKER_1: Do you think that.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.760
SPEAKER_2: And you're the one disrespecting believers.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.780
SPEAKER_1: Disrespecting, for no reason.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.100
SPEAKER_2: When we.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.780
SPEAKER_1: We're having an opinion.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.100
Hadassah.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.940
You're using this platform to roast our.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.200
SPEAKER_2: Hadassah, did I go to your house

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.360
or did you come to my house?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.880
Where are we right now?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.240
I came to your house.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.280
Oh, okay.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.280
So, okay.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.080
So I'm in my house.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.920
Okay, what?

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.380
So I'm in my house saying things in my own house.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.080
Did I force you to be here?

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.720
This is a public platform and you know it.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.840
But this is my stage, right?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.040
SPEAKER_1: You're trying to draw audiences.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.800
But this is a space that I.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.280
So you drew me.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.040
You drew me.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.800
It worked, didn't it?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.440
I'm drawn.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.560
SPEAKER_2: Yeah, it did.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.940
So this is a space that I made to say things

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.840
that I believe and have dialogue

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.580
about things that I believe.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.620
Do you think that I should be entitled

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.740
to say things that I believe

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.620
in a space that I create for myself?

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.080
Sure.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.120
Okay.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.540
What does that have to do with me

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.940
having the tone that I have?

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.420
Because you're coming in here

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.100
and you're upset that I have an opinion about things

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.960
and I'm saying it in my.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.980
SPEAKER_1: Yeah, because there's consequences.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.160
SPEAKER_2: And I'm saying it in my space,

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.300
a space that I created so I could say these things.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.440
I didn't come to you.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.000
I didn't knock on your door.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.940
I didn't come to your live stream.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.600
You came to me.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.660
So you can't come and complain.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.900
Your God is.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.700
You can't come and complain.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.020
Your God is imaginary.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.480
I'm saying things.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.420
SPEAKER_1: Prove me wrong.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.360
SPEAKER_2: That I'm saying things in a space

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.120
that I created for me specifically to say things.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.140
Your God is imaginary.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.000
Prove me wrong is what your room says.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120
Yeah, can you do it?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.880
Probably not.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.720
Oh, shit.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.320
Sounds like you're in the wrong place then.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.150
SPEAKER_1: It doesn't.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.530
It'll never happen.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.130
SPEAKER_2: That's why this room works for you.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.910
That's why this room will never go.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.330
SPEAKER_1: I expect the prophet of God to be able to prove me wrong.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.990
SPEAKER_2: Every coming to a con...

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.950
What can God do?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.370
It doesn't work that way.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.030
SPEAKER_1: What can God do?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.370
SPEAKER_2: It does not work that way.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.350
What can God do?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.300
SPEAKER_1: What can God do?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.820
Yeah.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.160
Anything.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.640
SPEAKER_2: Like what?

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:43.900
SPEAKER_1: Anything!

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.920
SPEAKER_2: Say one thing he can do.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.860
SPEAKER_1: It would take too long.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.640
It's called anything.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.220
To say one thing.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.820
He can do anything.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.000
What do you not conceive about that?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.640
SPEAKER_2: Name one of the things that is in anything.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.540
SPEAKER_1: What do you not conceive that is stupid?

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.140
I can do it.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.780
I can say, listen.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.020
It's too stupid.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.620
SPEAKER_2: I can say, Doug can do anything,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.340
but he can also wiggle his eyes.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.400
See, the wiggling of the eyes is a subset of anything.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.900
I'm looking for something that is a subset of anything.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.460
It didn't take a long time.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.360
What's one of the anything that God can do?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.000
What in the magician's trick shit is that?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.000
SPEAKER_1: What conversation are we having?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.940
SPEAKER_2: I'm just asking you, what can God do?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.980
SPEAKER_1: I'll let you pick.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.600
Pick your optimum one.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.800
What would you love for me?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.500
I don't believe in your God.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.200
What would you dream for me to say?

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.420
SPEAKER_2: I don't believe in your God.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.540
I'm asking you.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.560
No, tell me your dream response

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.660
that you think of in your head.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.580
I'm asking you, do you believe

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.680
that your God is capable of doing things?

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.010
He's capable of doing anything.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.510
Can you name even one of those things?

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.360
He can create the world.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.140
Cool, what's the evidence of that?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.320
SPEAKER_1: That the world is created.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.720
SPEAKER_2: No, that's not evidence that he created it.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.520
Yes, it fucking is.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.100
No, it didn't.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.040
Doug created it.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.340
Yeah, it is.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.620
What created it?

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.540
I just told you.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.380
No, Doug did.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.400
I just told you.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.720
Doug.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.900
You already saw him, Doug and his consort, Sharon Stone.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.060
They're the rock of ages,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.980
the firm foundation that you put your feet on.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.900
They instantiate all possibilities

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.200
and hold the grounding of all logic.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.840
They created everything.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.300
Okay.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.580
Not your God, your God's fake.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.690
SPEAKER_1: Okay.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.230
SPEAKER_2: So the evidence-

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.230
SPEAKER_1: Well, aren't we free to believe anything?

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.210
So what the hell are we doing?

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.610
SPEAKER_2: The evidence that Doug is God

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.990
is the fact that you exist, Hadassah.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.130
Doug's merciful enough to allow you to blaspheme him.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.620
Doug's merciful enough to allow you to blaspheme him.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:46.980
Okay.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.960
SPEAKER_1: I'm a prophet of Doug, by the way.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.860
SPEAKER_2: I'm a prophet of Doug.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.360
Doug sounds like, just like my guy.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.540
SPEAKER_1: I think we're talking about the same guy.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:54.880
SPEAKER_2: We're not.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.420
So let's do-

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.340
I think we are.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.800
We're gonna do a God competition.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.160
I'm gonna pray to Doug,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.280
and you're gonna pray to your God.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.140
We're gonna see who wins.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.540
So I'm gonna hold up.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.440
I'm gonna hold something up.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:05.880
I'm gonna hold on.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.880
So I'm gonna hold up this pen,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.180
and I'm gonna pray to Doug that the pen cap stays on.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.020
You have to pray to your God that the pen cap comes off,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.280
and we'll see who wins.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.380
I have to?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:20.940
Yeah, we're gonna see-

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.600
I have to?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.140
We're gonna see which God is more powerful.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.480
Okay, but what if I don't want to do that?

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.880
Well, you're just admitting that your God has no powers.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.340
No, I'm not admitting to that.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.060
I don't want to subject him to that.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.820
I think it's stupid.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.240
But can your God do it?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:35.720
I don't think you're an asshole.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.580
I don't want you to do it.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.380
SPEAKER_1: Again, it would-

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:38.780
Here's the thing.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.120
It would convert-

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.000
Here's what you don't understand.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.420
It would convert everybody here.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.320
SPEAKER_2: Okay, well, you don't talk to enough Christians.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:46.960
You don't talk-

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.420
Do you want to convert everybody here to Christianity?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:52.880
Do you?

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.390
SPEAKER_1: No, I do not, and neither does God.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.970
SPEAKER_2: Oh, so what do you want?

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.940
I want the gospel, the actual truth of the word,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.340
to be preached so that people can know

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.520
what they're turning down.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.480
Is the Bible true?

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.040
Yes, it is.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.140
Oh, okay.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.900
So in the Bible, when it says,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.200
have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies,

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.480
you know that they breed corals,

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.220
but it sounds like you're doing the opposite of that.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.380
SPEAKER_1: That doesn't make it not true.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.880
What else dumb shit you got to say?

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.020
SPEAKER_2: You're literally doing it right now.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.280
You're engaging in-

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.080
SPEAKER_1: It doesn't make it not true.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.200
In stupid and senseless controversies.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.940
SPEAKER_2: It's proving that it's correct.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.520
Oh, you haven't proved anything correct.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.700
What the fuck?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.140
It says,

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.640
Are you correcting people with gentleness right now?

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.580
No.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.940
So you don't believe in the word of God?

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.940
SPEAKER_1: I am not doing that very well right now.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.380
SPEAKER_2: But it says you're supposed to.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:02.600
It says,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.680
The Lord's servant must not be coralsome,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.540
but kindly to everybody.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.880
But aren't you a prophet?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.540
SPEAKER_1: It does say you're supposed to.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.240
Yes, I am.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.540
SPEAKER_2: Didn't you know this verse existed?

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.540
I do know that verse exists.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.840
But you're not being very humble.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.080
SPEAKER_1: Do you not know how to just,

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.660
it's like a family.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.180
It's not this thing you conform to.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.500
It's a guidebook, okay?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.200
SPEAKER_2: The family, what are you talking about?

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.260
The family is a genetic group.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.140
I'm trying to explain.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.640
Had you ever been a Christian?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.120
I was a Christian for 20 years.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.880
That's why I know that Jesus isn't real.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.960
SPEAKER_1: Oh, okay.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.820
SPEAKER_2: So you're disgruntled.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.480
That's what it is.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.160
SPEAKER_1: No, I'm not disgruntled.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.640
SPEAKER_2: Listen.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.340
SPEAKER_1: No, you're the way you are.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:44.720
No, I'm not.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.240
You are.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.120
You're disgruntled.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:46.880
Yeah, you are.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.360
No, I'm not.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.600
SPEAKER_2: I think you're the problem.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:48.900
SPEAKER_1: No, I'm not.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.620
I think you are.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:49.980
SPEAKER_2: No, I'm not.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.840
Because everything was fine and now y'all are.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.260
It's like she thinks that calling me a liar is a valid argument.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.920
Listen, I had a delightful time in Christianity.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.420
I know that it's not true because I studied the Bible professionally.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.840
I went to Bible college and seminary.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.260
And I know that Jesus didn't fulfill a single prophecy.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.360
The Bible is full of contradictions.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.020
It's full of scientific inaccuracies.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.200
And it's 100% true.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.000
Everything I said is true.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.020
You want me to prove it for you?

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.820
I believe that you went to seminary.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.260
It's a very common problem.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.280
It happens to a lot of people in seminary.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.580
Do you want me to prove my claims?

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:25.980
Prove your claim?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.820
No, because I know what you're going to say.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.540
I can prove it.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.640
SPEAKER_1: And furthermore, people like you, people like you.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.660
SPEAKER_2: OK, so you're saying I'm wrong, but you don't actually want me to prove my claim.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.360
I don't think you actually know how debates work.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.920
The way that debates work is typically like one person makes a claim.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.120
Another person might make a counterclaim.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.660
And then the different people debating need to actually provide like logic,

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.460
reason, evidence for their claims.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.640
Now, as it turns out, my claims, I can back up.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.860
Like I can go to the Bible.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.960
I can show you where it contradicts itself.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.020
I can go to the Bible.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.480
I can show you where it says Jesus fulfilled prophecies that he never actually fulfilled.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.000
I can back up my claims.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.200
All I'm asking you is, would you like me to back up my claims?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.260
Or are you afraid of me actually doing that and proving you're wrong?

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:28.250
If I surprisingly crumble every last one of your claims to dust,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.550
SPEAKER_1: what are you going to do then?

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.670
Are you just going to mute me and cut me off?

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.290
SPEAKER_2: Not even close to worried about it.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.410
SPEAKER_1: You're not worried about it.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.030
I asked you what you're going to do because these people need to know.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.090
SPEAKER_2: Because then you're going to gaslight them and say that some shit is going on.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.970
It isn't going on.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.230
You're not going to panic and mute me?

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.570
SPEAKER_1: No.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.550
All right, go through your dumbass shit.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.070
SPEAKER_2: Only if you continue to be rude and interrupt like you have been.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.170
That's the only reason why you're getting muted.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.850
SPEAKER_1: You know that, right?

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.530
Oh, OK.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.430
You see what he's going to use?

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.410
SPEAKER_2: You see what he's going to use?

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:04.170
So just so you're aware, you're the reason you keep getting muted, not me.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.710
You're getting muted because you're the one being rude.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.610
You're the one over talking everybody.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.190
You're the one that can't hold an adult conversation.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.630
All you actually have to do is behave like an adult and I wouldn't mute you.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.450
In fact, I don't want to mute you.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:26.530
I would prefer to not mute you, but I can't do that because every time I talk, you talk,

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.870
which is why you keep getting muted and you're doing it right now.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.310
You're still doing it as I'm explaining to you why you're getting muted.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.330
You're doing the thing that I said is going to get you muted.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.100
OK, OK.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.700
So now I would love to take turns.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.780
I have no problem taking turns.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.180
The problem is I sense that you don't want to take turns talking.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.700
Bro, I'm on the spectrum and you take in so much fucking time, bro.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.180
SPEAKER_1: Just well, first of all, these claims that are so wonderful.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.560
SPEAKER_2: Being on the spectrum doesn't have anything to do with your bad behavior.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.060
My son is heavily.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.480
Are you on the spectrum?

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.660
My son is on the spectrum and he doesn't behave like you.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.660
And my son is a level three on the spectrum, which is as high as it goes.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.520
OK, well, I was born in 80.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.080
The problem isn't that you're on the spectrum.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:26.060
The problem is that you're full of yourself and you can't actually behave like an adult.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.800
That's why you're behaving the way that you behave.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.680
I work with quite a few people that are on the spectrum because I'm an electrical engineer

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.440
and I work with a bunch of engineers.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:42.400
And as it turns out, engineering people in engineering are quite likely quite often on

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.080
the spectrum.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.320
So being on the spectrum doesn't mean that you have to be a piece of shit because the

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.360
people that I work with are delightful.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.220
And I know for a fact that a couple of them are on the spectrum.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.580
So would you like to first talk about how the Bible contains contradictions?

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.280
Is that an easy place to start?

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.880
Sure.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.900
OK, is it your belief that the Bible contains contradictions?

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.820
Yes or no?

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:08.540
No.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.880
OK, does the Bible even contain one contradiction?

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.660
No.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.320
OK, now, if I did show you a contradiction, this is a hypothetical.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.460
If I did show you a contradiction, what would it mean?

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.500
I would probably be able to tell you how that's not a contradiction.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.040
And then you would say some bullshit about how I'm wrong about that.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.120
That wasn't my analogy.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.980
My analogy said if I did show you a true contradiction, what would it mean?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.800
OK, clearly I'm going to have to break out of your analogy if I'm going to show you

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.720
something you've never seen.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.700
Nope, wrong again.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.780
SPEAKER_1: OK, well, then I guess where you're not allowed to end your stream forever, I guess.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.380
SPEAKER_2: So my analogy…

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.220
That makes sense.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.120
My analogy includes the fact that I showed you a bona fide contradiction.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.140
I'm saying if I did indeed show you a true contradiction, what would it mean about the Bible?

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.780
SPEAKER_1: First of all, you've got to look at every translation because translations are tricky.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.500
SPEAKER_2: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.760
Do you know Greek and Hebrew?

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.120
I know my way around a translation.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.280
That's another thing you learn with a master's in English.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.860
You know research pretty good.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.760
SPEAKER_1: You're doing a lot of writing, a lot of papers.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.240
SPEAKER_2: Did you learn the original languages?

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.100
I learned many languages.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.440
I understand how languages work.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.400
Did you learn how to read Greek and Hebrew?

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.320
Do you know why they tell you to do that?

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.820
It's crazy that you can't actually say yes or no.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.660
Answer the question.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.540
Do you know Greek and Hebrew?

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.680
You know why I can't?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.380
You know why I can't?

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.240
Because you have already established in your mind that that is the height…

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:52.080
All I want to know is if you can read the original languages that the Bible was written in

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.240
because that seems to be the most important thing.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.120
If you think something's mistranslated,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.940
what we should be doing is going back and seeing what was in the original language.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.100
So I'm asking you, do you know the original languages?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.460
SPEAKER_1: Everything I don't know can be found.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.320
SPEAKER_2: Google Translate exists and also there's Bible apps.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.120
I don't know why she can't answer a question.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.700
All I asked was whether or not you know the original languages.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.980
All you have to say is either yes or no.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.920
I'll answer your question when you answer me if you're capable of free…

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.640
Wrong again.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.100
I asked you a question already.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.340
I'm not going to let you run from it.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.500
It's an easy question.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.980
The question is, do you actually know Greek and Hebrew?

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:38.780
Is this yes or no?

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.500
You're not going to let me run from it?

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.320
It's yes or no.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.860
SPEAKER_1: It's an irrelevant question.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.680
SPEAKER_2: It's yes or no.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.500
It's irrelevant.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.340
It's yes or no.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.340
SPEAKER_1: It's okay.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.020
SPEAKER_2: Do I know the Greek or Hebrew?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.740
I know enough.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.960
I study it quite a bit.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.260
I know some words actually.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:56.660
Okay.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.600
So you know a couple words.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.640
I can't have a hold of conversation.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.740
SPEAKER_1: No, but I have studied the Greek and the Hebrew and it's look upable.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.580
Do you know what?

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:04.900
For what sake?

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.220
Do you know what the thing is a concordance?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.000
SPEAKER_2: Do you know what the heiress conjugation is in Greek?

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.220
The what?

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.440
The heiress conjugation.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.400
SPEAKER_1: The heiress?

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:16.880
SPEAKER_2: Yeah.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.780
Is that the verb to be?

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:19.760
No.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.900
What is it?

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.100
It's a form of conjugation in Greek.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.840
So you don't know Greek.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.100
Cool.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.580
All right.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.820
An heiress conjugation.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.460
No, no, no, no.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:27.920
Excuse me.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.800
SPEAKER_1: All conjugations are the same.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.480
SPEAKER_2: No, they're not.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.660
SPEAKER_1: All conjugation.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.440
Yes, they are.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.280
SPEAKER_2: You got a first person, second person, third person.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:35.580
Wrong.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.840
Yes, they are, bro.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.900
SPEAKER_1: Yes, they are.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.520
SPEAKER_2: You can act and you can look it up.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:40.820
You're wrong.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.780
You can look up.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.900
No, I'm not wrong.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.260
I have a degree.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.180
I've studied.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.140
You don't have a degree in Greek.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.840
If you did, you would know that the heiress conjugation is a way of conjugating verbs

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:58.380
where the action of the verb happened in the past but is actually ongoing.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.260
So it's a past tense verb that is still continuing, right?

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.020
That's an heiress verb in the Greek.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.980
I asked you that because it's a very common way of forming verbs in Greek.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.900
And I'm just curious if you actually know any Greek or if you just like learned a word once

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.300
and now you think you know Greek.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.840
Learned a word once.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.880
I just told you I have a degree in English.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.700
All you're doing is describing.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.840
But not in Greek, okay.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.260
And you don't know any Hebrew either.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.500
I'm not even going to ask you about Hebrew verbal stems.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.600
It's a verb.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.980
That'd be a complete waste.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.980
Okay, so now let's talk about the actual contradiction.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.960
So what I'd like you to do is open your Bible and go to 1 Chronicles 21.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.660
Can you do that?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.280
He doing some illusionist bullshit on y'all.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.360
Yeah, because you're a liar.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.840
Just go ahead and turn to 1 Chronicles 21.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.620
SPEAKER_1: And the only people that know are you and me.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.880
SPEAKER_2: No, you don't know anything.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.540
You're the Dunning-Kruger effect, remember?

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.000
Just turn to 1 Chronicles 21.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.560
We'll actually get to the point.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.540
SPEAKER_1: 1 Chronicles 21.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.140
Oh yeah, like you understand anything about the Old Testament.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.060
We'll be here for a while, I'm sure.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.520
SPEAKER_2: I literally have two degrees in Biblical studies,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.620
both of them focusing in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.960
SPEAKER_1: Like I said, like I said, like I said.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.120
SPEAKER_2: So between the two of us, I would say one of us

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.020
is actually prepared to read the Old Testament.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.600
SPEAKER_1: Between the two of us.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.240
SPEAKER_2: So 1 Chronicles 21.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.100
Are you there yet?

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.700
Let me know.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.040
Yeah, you're right, Mason.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:34.860
She's new here.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.620
She don't know.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.660
She's going to find out today.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.720
Let me know when you get to about verse 11 in 1 Chronicles 21.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.300
It's going to be a wild night.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.320
I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I'm having so much fun.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.380
I might stay on all night with Hadassah.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.640
Zosia, did you find the verse yet?

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.840
Do you know where Chronicles is?

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.500
Or do you have to look at like the reference guide

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.400
at the beginning of the Bible?

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.500
Maybe God will give you a prophecy about how to find it.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.790
She's probably still yelling.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.370
She don't even know she muted right now.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.040
You never did tell me from where in 1 Chronicles.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.120
I did 21.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:22.940
1 Chronicles what?

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.520
21 11.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.960
1 Chronicles 21 11.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.420
SPEAKER_1: Okay.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.730
All right, who's reading it?

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.590
Am I reading or what?

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:35.490
SPEAKER_2: I'll read it for you.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:36.690
In fact, I'll put it on the screen.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:38.790
Okay.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.850
It says Gad, that's the prophet.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.870
It didn't say God.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.140
The Gad came to David and said to him, let's say at the Lord, take your choice.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.720
Three years of famine or three months of devastation by your foes while the

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:57.150
sword of your enemies overtakes you or three days of the sword of the Lord pestilence on the land.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:03.210
So Gad is giving three options to David for a punishment.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.090
And the first option is three years of famine.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.450
The second option is three months of devastation.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.610
And the third option is three days of pestilence.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.450
Follow so far.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.450
Yes.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:18.070
Okay.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:24.930
Now the parallel story, because this story is told twice, is going to be in the book of Samuel.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:31.830
If you go to 2 Samuel 24, we get the identical same story, except something is different.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.090
Let me see if you can find it in verse 12.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.430
He says, go and say to David, thus say at the Lord, three things I offer you,

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.990
choose one of them, and I will do it to you.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:45.730
Gad came to David and told him and he asked him, shall seven years of famine come to you

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.850
on your land or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.210
or shall there be three days pestilence in your land?

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.490
Did you spot the difference?

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.670
Uh-huh.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.190
Yeah.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.070
Where's the difference?

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.470
SPEAKER_1: The one says three and one says seven.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:01.010
SPEAKER_2: Yeah.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.010
Are those the same numbers?

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:04.110
No.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.150
So then was it three or seven?

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.320
I don't know.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.080
I have to do some further research on it.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.600
Sounds to me like it's just a contradiction.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.380
SPEAKER_1: It's a big ass book and all of it intersects.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.780
SPEAKER_2: I know.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.080
That's why I know it's a contradiction.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.540
No, you don't know that it's a contradiction.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.240
I do.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.260
No, you don't.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.100
I do because three and seven are different numbers.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.780
SPEAKER_1: Oh my God.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.880
Let's throw the whole fucking book out.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.960
Oh, this is-

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.100
That's really responsible.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.240
SPEAKER_2: This is literally just a tip of the iceberg.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.000
You want to keep going?

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.060
Sure.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.000
All right.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.320
Today you're going to learn.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.660
Mark chapter two.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.500
I assume you know where Mark is.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:45.960
SPEAKER_1: No, no, no.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.880
Actually, yeah, you're right.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.160
I am because when I come back and look at every last one of these

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.560
and end your fucking channel,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.780
I'm going to fucking spit on your grave.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.600
SPEAKER_2: Can't wait.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.560
I literally cannot wait for you to come back and give me-

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.860
SPEAKER_1: I know that you can't wait.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.240
I know that you can't wait.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.480
SPEAKER_2: Give me your bad apologetics

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.700
because I already know all the apologetical answers for this.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.160
SPEAKER_1: My bad apologetics, bro.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.840
SPEAKER_2: I said I'm a prophet.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.060
And they don't work here.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.600
I said I'm a prophet.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.480
Mark chapter two, verse 26.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.260
SPEAKER_1: First one was, wait, first Chronicles 21, 11.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.740
Okay.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.800
This one is what?

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.840
SPEAKER_2: The other one was in second Samuel and-

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.580
Second Samuel.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:20.960
Let's see.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.900
What chapter were we in?

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.580
Second Samuel.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.400
It was going to be chapter 24.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.080
Maybe you can ask God for guidance.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.080
SPEAKER_1: Isn't it-

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.860
SPEAKER_2: Exactly what I'm going to do.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.560
It's interesting that I bet your research is going to be looking stuff up on the internet

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.180
and not getting revelation from God.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.280
I'm willing to bet that.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.240
But anyways, let's go to Mark chapter two.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.440
SPEAKER_1: Okay, fine.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:54.840
SPEAKER_2: Keep going.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.440
Listen, you go and go to apologeticspress or gotquestions.org,

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.000
come back with the bad answer,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.420
and I'll cook you on your bad answer just like I'm cooking you now.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.720
So Mark chapter two-

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.680
SPEAKER_1: No, you're not going to cook me on shit.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.140
Yeah, I will.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:07.520
SPEAKER_2: Go to Mark-

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.600
You're going to get cooked.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.500
In your dreams.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.860
Go to Mark chapter two for me.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.500
In your dreams.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:12.900
What?

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.860
Go to Mark chapter two.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.620
No, you said second Samuel 24.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.420
We're already done with it.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.640
And then you didn't say anything else.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.020
No.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:20.720
What did we say?

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.080
It's already done.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.640
Three and seven are different.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.520
SPEAKER_1: No, that was first Chronicles 2111.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.200
SPEAKER_2: Which is a contradiction of first Samuel 24.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.200
Or second Samuel 24.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.560
SPEAKER_1: Oh, those are addressing the same thing.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.760
SPEAKER_2: It's the same story.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.520
Two different authors, different details.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.100
SPEAKER_1: Second Samuel 24.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.640
Second Samuel 24.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.040
He wasn't king in second Samuel.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.780
SPEAKER_2: Yeah, he was.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.320
Hold up.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.000
Hold up.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.480
Sure was.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.200
Second Samuel 24.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.000
SPEAKER_1: Literally the same chapter.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.120
Let me just double check.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.540
Let me just double check.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.680
Did you just say it in any fucking way?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.520
SPEAKER_2: Literally the same story.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.080
SPEAKER_1: You could put those two chapters-

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.600
It says, David enrolls the fighting men.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680
Hold up.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.700
SPEAKER_2: Put the two chapters side by side.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.820
The same story.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.440
SPEAKER_1: David enrolls the fighting men.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:11.360
SPEAKER_2: You're right.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.740
Freed, she was supposed to be smarter, right?

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.080
I expected better from a Christian being

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.680
that they're supposed to be smarter than an atheist.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.660
This does not indicate smartness.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.040
You're not getting me on that showy bullshit.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.160
It seems to me like you're not very smart

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.320
if you don't know that these are the same chapters.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.260
SPEAKER_1: You're not getting me smart.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.600
This ginormous book.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.140
SPEAKER_2: Three and seven is all you got.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.940
Two numbers.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.200
I got a lot more than that.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.080
I got so much.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.920
You got seven typos where it said comb instead of brush.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.180
Nope, not even close.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.420
I've got so much more if you can actually get the mental-

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.160
SPEAKER_1: The second one is just a shadow of the first one.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.120
SPEAKER_2: If you can actually muster the mental fortitude

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.220
to keep forging on, you can see some more.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.290
SPEAKER_1: Keep going.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.150
SPEAKER_2: Okay.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.350
Did you find Mark chapter two yet?

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.570
No, what is it?

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.090
Go ahead and turn to Mark chapter two.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.550
SPEAKER_1: Mark chapter two, the whole chapter?

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.290
What the fuck?

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:09.950
Verse 26.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:10.790
What's the verse?

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.790
SPEAKER_2: Verse 26.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.090
2-26.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.630
SPEAKER_1: Okay.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:19.830
SPEAKER_2: Mark 2-26.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.110
Now, Jesus is speaking here.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.530
I don't want to say this is like, this is, this should be,

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.130
none of these should even count.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.270
These are eyewitness accounts.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.410
Do you think Mark was a disciple?

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:35.370
Mark wrote it.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.270
SPEAKER_1: No, Mark wrote it on behalf of Peter.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:39.790
SPEAKER_2: Oh, where's that in the Bible?

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.590
It's Peter's.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.210
SPEAKER_1: That's known just like you pulled out that Barnabas shit.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.250
That's not in the Bible.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.330
SPEAKER_2: Yeah, Colossians chapter four.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.190
Mark, would you read it for me?

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.830
SPEAKER_1: Colossians chapter four, what about it?

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.210
SPEAKER_2: Says that John Mark is the cousin of Barnabas.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.640
You haven't read this book, have you?

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.620
SPEAKER_1: Okay, what does that have to do with anything?

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.840
SPEAKER_2: You have no idea what's in this book.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.800
Listen, you don't have to perform for everybody.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.500
SPEAKER_1: It's crazy to me.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.880
SPEAKER_2: You don't have to perform everybody.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.400
SPEAKER_1: All right.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.220
SPEAKER_2: Mark was not, was writing on behalf of Peter.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.340
Everybody knows that.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:10.700
No, they don't.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.640
That's Peter's.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.160
SPEAKER_1: I disagree.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:12.800
SPEAKER_2: That's Peter's point.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.260
Of course everybody knows that.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.740
Yes, they do.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.180
I disagree.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.020
Yes, they do.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.480
I disagree.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:17.900
Okay.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.980
Well, they should because it's old news.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.780
SPEAKER_1: It's not old news.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.520
They only started changing that.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.080
It's mythology.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.780
SPEAKER_2: Nah, it's just mythology.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.580
SPEAKER_1: No, it's not fucking mythology.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.400
How old are you?

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.240
SPEAKER_2: It's mythology.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:30.980
Mark chapter two.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.860
How old are you?

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.120
I mean, if you want to read the book, we can read the book.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.580
It sounds like you're afraid to read the book.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.660
You know why it's mythology?

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.540
Because it's true, bro.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.560
It sounds to be that you're afraid.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.360
SPEAKER_1: Why would they lie about it?

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.400
SPEAKER_2: It sounds like you're afraid to read the book.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.160
You want to read it?

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.020
I'm not afraid to read the book.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.340
SPEAKER_1: It's on the-

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.120
I'm saying that-

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.980
SPEAKER_2: It's on the screen right now.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.000
I know about what Mark is.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.520
You don't.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.020
Hadassah, read what's on the screen.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:50.560
Yes, I do.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.660
Read what's on the screen.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.960
How he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the presence,

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.380
which is not lawful for any but the priest to eat.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.660
SPEAKER_1: He gave some to his companions.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:01.920
SPEAKER_2: Right.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.120
And who's this about?

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.820
Do you know what's happening in Mark chapter two?

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.640
David.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.360
Okay, right.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.860
Now, do you believe that when David went into the temple or the shrine at Nob

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.240
and ate the showbread that Abiathar was the high priest?

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.890
Yeah.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.270
Oh, really?

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.550
Okay.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.910
Do you know where that story comes from?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.240
Somewhere in Samuel.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.600
Yeah, because I'm typing it on the screen.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.480
First Samuel 21.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.020
All right, so now-

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.000
No, I know where-

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.300
I've read my Bible.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.040
Well, I'm sure.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.380
You've demonstrated that so well to us.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.980
I read it for funsies.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.960
David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.180
and said to him, why are you alone and no one with you?

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.060
And then what happens?

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.400
He has a whole conversation with Ahimelech and Ahimelech gives him the showbread.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.700
He says, give me five loaves of bread and whatever is here.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.300
I have no ordinary bread at hand, only the holy bread.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.340
So who's the high priest here?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.140
It says Ahimelech.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:02.740
Oh, shit.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.200
Is Ahimelech Abiathar?

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:07.980
I don't know.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.560
No, no, they're not.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.880
They're different people.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.410
Okay.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.470
That doesn't change the point of anything.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.210
That means Mark chapter 2 verse 26 is wrong.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.530
They quoted the Old Testament wrong.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:22.670
That's another contradiction.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:23.210
Want to see more?

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.750
SPEAKER_1: Okay.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.570
The Jesus himself quoted the Old Testament wrong.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.430
How about that then?

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:28.310
SPEAKER_2: I love it.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.150
Matthew 22.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.170
We'll do it right now.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.550
We'll do Luke 4 and Matthew 22 and shit.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.690
Well, there's even a passage in Matthew where he misquotes Psalm 8.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.990
But my favorite is Matthew 22.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:45.870
If you go down to verse 41, it says while the Pharisees were gathered together,

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.350
Jesus asked them this question.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.130
What do you think of the Messiah?

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.970
Whose son is he?

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.770
They said to him, the son of David.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:57.850
And he said to them, how is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord,

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:02.410
saying, the Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet?

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.150
What is Jesus saying?

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.550
Why is he quoting Psalm 110 here?

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.170
Because he's asking who the Lord is in the sentence.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.090
Right.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:14.970
SPEAKER_1: But what's he saying?

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.050
And how can it be his son?

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.010
SPEAKER_2: What is he suggesting about the Messiah?

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.980
SPEAKER_1: He's suggesting that the label is not correct.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:31.020
SPEAKER_2: He's suggesting that the Messiah is not just the son of David.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.300
The Messiah is also on par with God.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:36.340
Right?

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.280
SPEAKER_1: No, I don't think that's what that means.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.180
I think that means that he is questioning the son of David moniker.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.840
He's saying, why do we say, why are we saying this?

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.380
And the scripture says this.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.240
SPEAKER_2: So they were calling him son of David.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.900
So Jesus is making something very interesting here.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.220
He's just saying, if David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.660
He's just saying that the Messiah is going to be Lord, right?

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:07.840
Right.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.500
Okay. So do you believe then that when Jesus is quoting this text,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.500
like I should go back to Psalm 110 and I should see David saying,

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.500
the Lord said to my Lord, right?

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.100
Sure.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.460
Have you read Psalm 110?

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.990
SPEAKER_1: A couple of times, probably, yeah.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.270
SPEAKER_2: Interesting.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:35.830
It's a big book.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:36.670
I read it.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:37.190
I read it.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.450
It's part of my life.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.170
SPEAKER_1: So I don't have a stick up my ass.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:46.250
I don't have a medal for how many hours I spent reading the Bible, like some people.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.370
SPEAKER_2: Audifer, prophetess.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:53.010
So Psalm 110 starts out with naum Yahweh, which means an oracle of Yahweh.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:53.870
SPEAKER_1: It doesn't actually-

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.910
Oh, slandon.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.530
SPEAKER_2: I don't think you actually know what I just said.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:02.010
So it doesn't start out saying that the Lord said to my Lord.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:10.050
It says naum Yahweh la adoni, which means an oracle of Yahweh to my master.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.330
That's what that means.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:16.850
This is clearly an oracle from somebody in King David's court about King David,

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.290
which is why he literally says,

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.090
Sit at my right hand until I make thy enemies my footstool.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:27.050
The exact promise made to David that came true in 1 Kings chapter 5.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.390
So this is not David even speaking.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.230
That is somebody's interpretation.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:31.990
No, it's not.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:33.190
That's someone's interpretation.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.730
If Jesus is using that-

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.810
Jesus is using-

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:40.390
Jesus himself is using that as reference to himself.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:41.670
Do you know why he's wrong?

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.510
Oh, Jesus is wrong.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:44.450
Oh, shit.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.090
SPEAKER_1: Okay, you're that deluded.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.910
SPEAKER_2: Do you want to know why he's wrong?

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:50.990
Why is he wrong?

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.810
Because he doesn't know how to read Hebrew,

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:55.330
or whoever wrote the Gospel of Matthew didn't know how to read Hebrew.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:56.470
They're quoting it from the Greek.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:57.910
Do you know what the Greek text says?

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.160
What does it say?

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.480
It says the Lord said to my Lord.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.900
Do you want to know why it says that?

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.660
Why does it say that?

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.260
Because just like our English Bibles,

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.480
rather than saying the name of Yahweh,

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.420
quite often they would say the Lord instead of Yahweh

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.440
to protect the divine name.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.520
So in the Greek text, it literally says,

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.260
ha-kiri-as, the Lord said to my Lord.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.740
If you're reading that,

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.020
it sounds like it's talking about two different Lords.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.500
But when you read it in the original Hebrew,

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.160
it's clear that there are not two Lords.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:42.940
There is an oracle of Yahweh to a Lord, to the master.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.740
Adonai just means my master.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.400
It's what they called the king.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.780
Adonai is the name of God.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:51.840
It's plural.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.560
It doesn't say Adonai and Adonai is not plural.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.640
Well, what does it say then?

00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.760
It says Adonai.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.000
Adonai is a different vowel pointing.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.820
Okay, so I don't agree with your interpretation.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.420
That's just an interpretation.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.120
Well, then show me where it's wrong.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.900
First of all, first of all, okay, listen.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.140
SPEAKER_1: Listen, listen.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.900
So first of all, did you know that...

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.360
Like I said.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.920
SPEAKER_2: Did you know that...

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.780
Are we going to have an actual conversation?

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.500
Not if you keep talking.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.500
SPEAKER_1: Because I don't think you're capable of that.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.960
SPEAKER_2: I don't think you're capable of that.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.020
Does the word...

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.760
You got me going down your funnel.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.640
You got me going down your weird-ass funnel,

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.760
thinking this is important.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.180
SPEAKER_1: What does...

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.400
SPEAKER_2: None of this change...

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.200
We'll just try this again.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.120
Does the word is that a verb or noun?

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:40.860
Do you know?

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.340
What is what?

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.720
Is it a verb or noun?

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.200
Is what a verb or a noun?

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.920
The word I have highlighted, is that a verb or noun?

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.300
What does it mean?

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.760
I'm asking you.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.900
Is it a verb or a noun?

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.440
I don't know what the inter...

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.260
What the translation of the word is, so I wouldn't know.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.260
Okay, it's a noun.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.240
It's not actually a verb.

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.020
It doesn't say that Yahweh said anything.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.320
It just says an oracle of Yahweh.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.720
Do you know that Bible apps have Hebrew on them?

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:15.580
SPEAKER_1: I know.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.920
SPEAKER_2: I would click on it right...

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.500
Which is why I like went to school to learn Hebrew.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.300
So like I wouldn't have to do dumb things like use websites.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:24.920
SPEAKER_1: So, Naum...

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.920
You went to school to learn something that you can just look up on an app.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.260
I know, yeah.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:28.980
Congrats, bro.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:29.340
SPEAKER_2: I know.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.160
You went to learn English.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.420
You went to learn something that I learned as a fifth grader.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.260
That's what you did.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.920
I went to school and I actually learned the original languages and history of the Bible.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.400
You're arrogant.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:41.900
Okay.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.540
I'm not arrogant.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.340
I'm just right.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:51.220
The fact of the matter is, Naum wasn't a verb.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.900
It's actually a noun, right?

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.080
SPEAKER_1: Nothing.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.640
All you're saying is gobbledygook, bro, and I know it.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.720
SPEAKER_2: It's not gobbledygook.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.580
Yes, it is.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.240
It doesn't prove...

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.420
Do you think that verbs and nouns are the same?

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.380
SPEAKER_1: Are you an asshole and a cocksucker?

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.840
SPEAKER_2: It sounds to me like you're incapable of answering the question.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.820
Do you think that verbs and nouns are the same?

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.360
Do you think that your arrogant act is fooling any fucking body?

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.100
It sounds to me like you're feeling a little hot under the collar and you're incapable

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.800
of engaging with the dialogue, which is why you're crashing out like a toddler.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:32.620
So the question was, do you think that verbs and nouns mean the same thing?

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:42.680
If in fact, this is a noun, it doesn't say that God spoke.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.260
It doesn't say that Yahweh spoke.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:51.880
It actually is announcing something.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.080
So the question is, what is it announcing?

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.600
They don't need these stupid ass arguments.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.620
You've got real power.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.140
Oh shit, what power do you have?

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.040
Show me your power.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520
SPEAKER_1: You're an asshole.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.420
Show me the power.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:14.300
SPEAKER_2: I got the power to see through your bullshit and know that it has nothing to do with the truth.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.320
SPEAKER_1: The people are thirsty for someone who's going to give them something real.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.040
It sounds like you're incapable of doing that.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:21.640
SPEAKER_2: You copied.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.240
SPEAKER_1: All you did was copy the pharisaical Christian model, make it secular.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.600
I'm not impressed.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.820
SPEAKER_2: It's retarded and the Lord's coming for it.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.000
SPEAKER_1: The prophet Hadassah is debuting today because it's Easter, Passover, and 420.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:38.840
What's good?

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.880
If you hear in my voice and it's 420, smoke your shit.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.140
Find the Lord because he out there calling the Lord.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.920
SPEAKER_2: I'm talking about Jesus.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.220
Sounds to me like you're out there.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.280
And I don't know if you know how this platform works, but this platform

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.780
is certainly not a place where you get to preach.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.600
So the question is whether or not you want to engage in some dialogue.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.020
I'm more than happy to engage in some dialogue.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.520
SPEAKER_1: Cut out the middle, man.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.520
Go find the Lord.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.740
Go find Jesus.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.400
I'm going to.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.040
That's what a Christian.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.620
What's good?

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.060
What's good?

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.900
The Lord is good.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.800
He loves you.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.840
Fuck the sky.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.580
That's all she got.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:26.220
He's a liar.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.340
SPEAKER_2: That's all she got.

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.000
SPEAKER_1: He's got pride.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:30.660
Praise.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.380
Pride.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:32.340
SPEAKER_2: Praise Jebus.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.740
SPEAKER_1: Pride is what caused this whole thing.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.600
SPEAKER_2: Let me know when you're done.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.940
I'll call your mama and have her come change your diapy.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:47.980
SPEAKER_1: Pride is what caused this whole thing.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.300
That's why.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.760
SPEAKER_2: I mean, at least she was fun.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.320
I mean, we'll give her that.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.400
She was fun, at least.
