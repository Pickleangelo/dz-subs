WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
how you doing, Hadassah? Very well. How are you? Doing very well. Thank you for asking. Hadassah,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:16.360
are you at least 18 and are you a believer? Yes and yes. I'm 42 actually. Right. And you believe

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.520
in some kind of a God? In Jesus, yes. Cool. What would be the best evidence or the best argument for the

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:35.400
Christian God being real? The best evidence would be the believers. Oh, tell me how because like the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.360
New Testament says that the believers are going to like behave a particular way and that like we

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.480
should know like Christians should be different from non-Christians but I don't see much of a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.550
difference. Right. Well, it's been 2,000 years. A lot happens in 2,000 years. So? I mean, are you aware

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.070
of the end times theology at all? I'm quite aware but that doesn't actually address what I was saying.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.410
Like the New Testament says that Christians are going to behave a particular way, right? Do you

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.750
believe that the Holy Spirit makes people a new creature? I do. Okay. Do you think that people

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.120
that are new creatures in Christ are going to behave the same as non-Christians? No, they're not.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.940
Okay. So they are going to behave slightly differently. Okay. And what sort of behaviors

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:32.210
would I expect from Christianity that I wouldn't expect from non-Christians? Humility for one and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.370
that's a big one. Okay. I'm going to, hold on, let me mark this down real quick. I want to make sure

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.230
I'm, I got, I don't want to forget these bullet points. So number one, Christians should have

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.310
humility. Okay. Anything else? Yes. I mean, right now that's the one that can't be mimicked as well

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:05.950
as the others. Sure. Yeah. But what are the others? Um, I mean, let's see. I mean, in this day and age,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.910
like I say, most things can be mimicked. Most people know the gospel, uh, knowledge to the degree

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.930
that they know it. So, and they like it, you know, everybody agrees that it's peaceful X, Y, Z,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.530
blah, blah, blah. So, so whatever, what other characteristics would I expect from the Christians?

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.550
Um, you're going to expect them to make better decisions, uh, quicker. Oh, like they're going

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.570
to be smarter. Um, they're going to be, they're going to have wisdom because they have chosen to

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.270
use a map rather than navigate their own way. Okay. So Christians should be more intelligent than

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.510
non-Christians. They are more intelligent than non-Christians. They are. Okay. So, okay. So just make

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.710
sure we're checking this off. So point number one, Christians are going to be humble. Point number

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.650
two, they're going to be smarter than Christians or non-Christians. Right. Okay. Anything else?

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.340
I don't know. I mean, what else is there? You know, the rest of it. I'm asking you. I'm trying to pick,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.960
I'm trying to pick things that are, that wouldn't normally be noticed, uh, because you seem lost

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.520
particularly about it. I mean, you could just tell me what the Bible is. So what does the Bible say

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.730
Christians are going to be like? Is that because that's the only text that you know? So we should

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.570
stick to the text. Why don't you tell them? Why don't you put your script out? You can make,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.110
you can make stuff up if you want. Listen, if you think there are other characteristics. I might be

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.750
able to. Would you be able to hang with the argument if I was, if I made stuff up right now?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.250
Oh, I'm, I'm certain. I'm certain I can hang with, probably not with any argument that you lay out.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.650
Really? Okay. Hadassah, remember you're supposed to be humble. Okay. So don't, don't,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.410
don't, don't. Right. Okay. Don't, don't. I can see through you. So no, you're not going to use

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.770
that shit as a leash. Don't, don't, don't. Oh, there it is. Okay. Don't, don't what? There it is.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.810
Point number one. There it is what? Calling you out. Point number one. Point number one. Point number

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.290
one was humility. Humility. Do you have humility? Do you have humility? See, you don't know what,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.590
you wouldn't know humility with both your hands, bro. That's what you said. What is,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.590
you don't know it. Do you know what humility means? You don't know what humility, no,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.530
you don't know what it is. It's crazy that, it's crazy that we started. You don't know what it is.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.630
Merely just asking you a couple of questions. And you, and I always get muted and you,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.790
we started the conversation by just asking a couple of simple questions. I haven't even

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.950
engaged in any like argumentation yet. And you're already upset calling me an asshole.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:03.770
Did I, did I say, did I say something to you? Yes, you did. What'd I say? You're full of shit.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.510
What'd I say to you? Everyone here knows it and feels it. And you're acting like an asshole.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.530
There's that humility. I don't care about your stupid,

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.590
I don't care about your stupid trophies. I know better than that. There's that humility

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.230
and love of Christ. I know better. I know better. Yeah, this is the love of Christ.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.830
Do you know what the, how would you know? How would you know? Do you know what the Dunning-Kruger

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.150
effect is? Yeah, it's some shit that used to be called something else. And then they named it

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.270
after some dude. I'm old enough to remember when they just fucking called it, whatever the fuck

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.950
they called it, common sense or whatever. What is it? What, what is the, what's the Dunning-Kruger

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.250
effect? Just give it to me, my guy. You said, you know, I don't sit in front of Google. I don't

00:05:45.250 --> 00:06:00.930
sit in front of Google memorizing the definitions of things. So people think I'm smart. So why don't

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.870
know what it is? If you don't know what it is, you should have said that you don't know what it is

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.090
because that would mean that. That's what you think smartness is. So that means you would actually

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.110
be humble, right? You said Christians are going to be more humble than non-Christians, which means

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.990
if you're being humble. Regitating. Humble people don't claim to know things that they don't

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.230
actually know. So what we've discovered so far is that you're not humble. You're a phony.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.230
Is that you're not humble. You're, and you're not behaving like a Christian and that you're also

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.730
a liar because you said that you knew what the Dunning-Kruger effect is, but now you're telling

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.410
me that you don't actually know what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. So, so you know what it is.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.210
Okay. Okay. What is it? Tell me then. What is it? What is it? What is it? What is that supposed

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.010
to prove whether I know what it is or not? Yeah. If you say, you know what something

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.330
is. I'm 42 years old, bro. I got a master's degree. I got a lot of shit in here. I'm sure

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.090
you do. So just save us some time, my guy. So you should be able to graciously save us

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.130
some time. So you should be able to tell me what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. Graciously

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.110
save us some time. I know you're looking right at it. So why don't you graciously save us

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.210
some time? I'm waiting for you to save time because you said you already know what it

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.990
is. I do know what it is. Sure. Then what is it? I've watched YouTube before. I looked

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.830
at the, I did that of my own volition. I didn't hear about it and then said, oh, I better make

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.070
sure I know about it. So what is it? I actually was interested in that shit. So what is it?

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:36.830
Oh God, for fuck's sake. It is some stupid ass explanation. Y'all try to make up to explain

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.770
why Christianity is still around, even though we can't answer your fucking questions. Not

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.170
even close to true. That's what it fucking is. That is exactly what it fucking is. How

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:51.550
much money you want to bet on that? What do you mean money that I want to bet? That's

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:58.010
my opinion of what that fucking thing is. Aren't you a prophet? Did God tell you this? You're

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:03.750
no, I, no, no, no, that he didn't tell me that. I looked that up, but I, you did, you

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.890
certainly, so you're a liar then. Cause you didn't look it up. So you don't know what the

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:15.630
Dunning Kruger effect is. My guy, my guy, it's just one of many things to know that we

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.730
could go, you could be Googling it right now. You're just trying to make me look weird.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.590
I'm making myself look weird. You're saying, did you save your time and look at the fuck

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.210
up? If you don't know what it is, you should have said you don't know.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.470
I, I know what the Dunning Kruger effect is. I'm 42 years old. I pick and choose what

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:39.150
shit I need to save in my brain. I just remember the conclusion. I remember the conclusion I

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.510
drew about it, which is what the fuck? Why are they trying to name old shit after some

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.270
guy and make it seem like it's some new ass information? That's not at all what it says.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.630
I just, that's, I just re that's what I remember reacting about it. Do you even know, do you

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.870
even know what the principle of the Dunning Kruger effect is? Just fucking tell us, bro.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.450
It's just a Google, but it's just two sentences tops. You're a prophet. All you have to do is

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:08.170
refresh my memory. No, that's not how it works, bro. Do you know, or do you know or not?

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.670
I don't remember. How about that? So then you don't know. You should have said you don't know

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:20.230
that. That wouldn't be true. That would be a lie. It would be a lie. You came up here lying. You

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.490
said you knew what it was, but you can't tell me what it was. No, I know what it is. I forgot.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.770
I probably forgot more shit than you fucking know in your life, bro. I'm sure of it. You haven't

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.330
demonstrated that so far though. What you've demonstrated is that you're a liar. Because

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.730
you haven't moved the conversation on. So the Dunning Kruger effect. I think people can tell

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.810
who's the, who the, who the dumb ass is and who isn't. Yeah, you got that right. The people can

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.390
certainly tell. Because I'm pissed off and I'm still, I'm still dominating. I know. You are so pissed

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.830
right now. So the Dunning Kruger effect. Yeah, I am pissed and I'm still dominating.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.170
Not even close. So the Dunning Kruger. Continue. So the Dunning Kruger effect is something that we

00:09:54.170 --> 00:10:00.450
find in psychology where people that are the least equipped and the least educated and the least

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:06.890
knowledgeable in particular subjects actually believe that they're more knowledgeable, more

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:12.290
capable when it's actually not true. Because as it turns out, the people who know the least are more

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.450
likely to believe that they know more than they actually know. Because they're not actually aware

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.530
of the things that they don't know. They're so delightfully unaware of what they don't know

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.930
that they think because they've learned a couple things that they actually know a lot.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:32.810
When in reality, the people who do get PhDs, the people who do learn a lot, the people that do excel

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:38.930
greatly actually start to underestimate how much they know. It's a really fun thing that happens in

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:45.870
psychology. So when people come up here, and they claim to know a whole lot, and I sense that maybe

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:51.730
they don't, I just ask them simple questions to find out if they know as much as they claim, which is

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:57.850
why I'm asking you questions. I want to test you. You're claiming that you're really smart. I just want

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:05.150
to know if you are. Okay, well, you could have just asked me what my credentials are. Sure. What are

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:11.590
your initials? Masters? Excuse me. I have a master's degree in English. And what are you laughing

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:17.430
about? You got a master's degree in English? You might as well have done underwater basket weaving.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:25.090
No, we're talking, this was 20 years ago. This was when degrees were actually very good still.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:32.290
This was while the internet was being born at the same time. Oh boy. And what do you do with

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:39.810
your master's degree in English? I'm a writer. That makes a lot of sense. Among other things.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:45.390
Sure. Does, does your master's degree in English equip you to be an expert in things that are not

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:56.050
English? Absolutely it does. Like what? Let me tell you how. I'll just ask you what. When you get, okay,

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.170
that's because that's what you think that's going to answer your question or something.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:05.470
Hadassah, I know how, I know how learning works. Excuse me. Hadassah, I know how learning works.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:10.890
Do you? Okay, okay, really? Okay, well, let me tell you how. What other fields? When you're in the

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:17.070
humanities, and I tell you, when you, when you get a degree in the humanities. So just cool, cool your

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:23.390
memories for a minute. I'm just asking you what other fields of study does getting a master's in

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:31.020
English prepare you for? It prepares you for quite a bit. Like what? Because you learn how to express

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.540
your ideas and have a conversation like we're doing now. I don't think we're having a conversation.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.180
So I've been skilled for many decades. Oh, I know you don't because I am dominating you with my pinky

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.800
and it's uncomfortable for you. Again, you're just demonstrating that you're falling into the

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.820
stunning Kruger effect. This is not. No, you're falling. Excuse me. Did you know that I had a

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:58.680
master's? Hadassah, just remember that as a Christian, you're supposed to be humble and you're

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.820
not being humble right now. I'm, I'm waiting for the humility because you're proving your claims to

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:13.480
be false. Imagine being a prophet of God. Does it look like that whip works on me, my dude?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.720
It does. Hadassah, you can put that whip away. Put your whip away. It doesn't work on me. Did you

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:26.400
know that I have a master's degree too? I don't care. You're the one being an asshole and you're

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:34.260
the one disrespecting believers for no reason. By having an opinion? When we, when we are having an

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:41.660
opinion, you're using this platform to roast our- Hadassah, did I go to your house or did you come

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:47.480
to my house? Where are we right now? I came to your house, but you know what? Okay. So, okay. So

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:55.680
I'm in my house. Okay. What? So I'm in my house saying things in my own house. Did I force you to be

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:02.260
here? This is a public platform and you know it. But this is my stage, right? You're trying to draw

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.260
audiences. But this is, this is a space that I- So you drew me. You drew me. I worked in it. Yeah. Okay.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:14.380
So this is a space that I made to say things that I believe and have dialogue about things

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.880
that I believe. Do you think that I should be entitled to say things that I believe in

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:26.900
a space that I create for myself? Sure. Okay. What does that have to do with me having the

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.100
tone that I have? Because you're coming in here and you're upset that I have an opinion

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.820
about things. And I'm saying it in my- Yeah. Because there's consequence- And I'm saying

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:43.260
it in my space, a space that I created so I could say these things. I didn't come to you.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.360
I didn't knock on your door. I didn't come to your live stream. You came to me. So you can't

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.020
come and complain. Your God is a- You can't come and complain- Your God is imaginary-

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:01.980
I'm saying things- Prove me wrong. It's the- That I'm saying things in a space that I created for me

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.860
specifically to say things. So- Your God is imaginary. Prove me wrong is what your room says.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.800
Yeah. Can you do it? Probably not. Oh shit. Sounds like you're in the wrong place then.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.030
It doesn't- It'll never happen. That's why- I expected a- That's why this room works for you.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.030
I expected a- That's why this room will never go- I expect a prophet of God to be able to prove

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.850
me wrong. You have no intention of every coming to a- What can God do? It doesn't work that

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:37.500
way. What can God do? It does not work that way. What can God do? What can God do? What

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:49.620
can God do? Yeah. Anything. Like what? Anything! Say one thing he can do. It would take too long.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.600
It's- It's called anything. He can do anything. To say one thing. What do you not conceive about

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.940
that? Name one of the things that is in anything. What do you not conceive that is stupid? I can do

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.360
it. I can say- It's stupid. It's too stupid. I can say, Doug can do anything, but he can also

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.680
wiggle his eyes. See, the wiggling of the eyes is a subset of anything. I'm looking for something

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.620
that is a subset of anything. It didn't take a long time. What's one of the anything that

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:21.920
God can do? What in the magician's trick shit is that? What conversation are we having?

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.460
I'm just asking you, what can God do? Why don't you pick? I'll let you pick. Pick your

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.880
optimum one. I don't believe in your God. What would you dream for me to say? I don't believe

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.580
in your God. I'm asking you. No. Tell me your dream response that you think of in your head.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.460
I'm asking you, do you believe that your God is capable of doing things?

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.310
He's capable of doing anything. Can you name even one of those things?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.920
He can create the world. Cool. What's the evidence of that?

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.520
That the world is created. No, that's not evidence that he created it.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.860
Yes, it fucking is. No, it didn't. Doug created it.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.260
Yeah, it is. What created it? I just told you. No, Doug did.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:16.980
Who is Doug? You already saw him. Doug and his consort Sharon Stone. They're the rock of ages,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.400
the firm foundation that you put your feet on. They instantiate all possibilities and hold

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.140
the grounding of all logic. They created everything. Okay.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.370
Not your God. Your God's fake. Okay.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.130
So the evidence... Well, aren't we free to believe anything? So what the hell are we doing?

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:40.710
The evidence that Doug is God is the fact that you exist, Hadassah. Doug's merciful enough to allow

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:46.820
you to blaspheme him. Doug's merciful enough to allow you to blaspheme him. Okay.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:53.140
Yeah, I'm a prophet of Doug, by the way. Doug sounds like just like my guy. I think we're

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.180
talking about the same guy. We're not. So let's do... I think we are. We're going to do a God

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.660
competition. I'm going to pray to Doug, and you're going to pray to your God, and we're going to see

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:08.520
who wins. So I'm going to hold up... I'm going to hold something up. Hold on. So I'm going to hold

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:15.460
up this pen, and I'm going to pray to Doug that the pen cap stays on. You have to pray to your God

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.220
that the pen cap comes off, and we'll see who wins. Ready? I have to?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.520
Well, yeah, we're going to see... I have to?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.300
We're going to see which God is more powerful. Okay, but what if I don't want to do that?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.780
Well, you're just admitting that your God has no powers.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.720
No, I'm not admitting to that. I don't want to subject him to that. I think it's stupid.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.320
But can your God do it? I don't think you're an asshole. I don't want you to do it.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.860
Again, it would... Here's the thing. It would convert... Here's the thing.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.780
It would convert everybody here. Here's what you don't understand.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.460
It would convert everybody here. Okay, well...

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.960
Do you want to convert... Okay, well, you don't talk to enough Christians. You don't talk...

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.550
Do you want to convert everybody here to Christianity? Do you?

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.830
No, I do not, and neither does God. Oh, so what do you want?

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:06.480
I want the gospel, the actual truth of the word to be preached, so that people can know what

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.240
they're turning down. Is the Bible true?

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.940
Yes, it is.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.820
Oh, okay. So in the Bible, when it says,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:19.220
have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies, you know that they breed corals,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.960
but it sounds like you're doing the opposite of that.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.760
That doesn't make it not true. What else dumb shit you got to say?

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.120
You're literally doing it right now. You're engaging...

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.760
It doesn't make it not true.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.120
...in stupid and senseless controversies.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.620
It's proving that it's correct.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.220
Oh, you haven't proved anything correct.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.580
What the fuck?

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.100
It says,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.920
The Lord's servants must not be quarrelsome, but kindly to everybody, an apt teacher, patient,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.460
correcting opponents with gentleness. Are you correcting people with gentleness right now?

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.360
No.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.840
So you don't believe in the word of God?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.800
I am not doing that very well right now.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.520
But it says you're supposed to. It says,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.340
The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but kindly to everybody.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.760
But aren't you a prophet?

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.160
It does say you're supposed to. Yes, I am.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.440
Didn't you know this verse existed?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.460
I do know that verse exists.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.580
But you're not being very humble.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.800
Is that... Do you not know how to just... It's like a family. It's not this thing you conform to.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.220
It's a guidebook. Okay?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.000
The family? What are you talking about? The family is a genetic...

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.740
I'm saying... I'm trying to explain.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.320
The family is a genetic group.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.480
Have you ever been a Christian?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.060
I was a Christian for 20 years.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.740
That's why I know that Jesus isn't real.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.420
Oh, okay. So you're disgruntled. That's what it is.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.040
No, I'm not disgruntled.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.240
Listen. No, you're the way you are.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.700
No, I'm not.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.940
You are. You're disgruntled.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.780
Yeah, you are.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.260
No, I'm not.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.380
I think you're the problem.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.560
I think, yeah, you are.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.000
No, I'm not.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.840
Because everything was fine, and now y'all...

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.020
It's like she thinks that calling me a liar is a valid argument.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.640
Listen, I had a delightful time in Christianity.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.340
I know that it's not true because I studied the Bible professionally.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.120
I went to Bible college and seminary, and I know that Jesus didn't fulfill a single prophecy.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.220
The Bible is full of contradictions.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.140
It's full of scientific inaccuracies, and it's 100% true.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.960
Everything I said is true.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.860
You want me to prove it for you?

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.780
I believe that you went to seminary.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.160
It's a very common problem.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.280
It happens to a lot of people in seminary.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.380
Do you want me to prove my claims?

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:25.920
Prove your claim?

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.720
No, because I know what you're going to say.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.500
I can prove it.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.900
And furthermore...

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.700
I can actually prove it.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.700
You want me to prove it?

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.180
And furthermore, people like you...

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:33.740
Do you believe it?

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.600
People like you...

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.580
Okay, so you're saying I'm wrong, but you don't actually want me to prove my claims.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.280
I don't think you actually know how debates work.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.180
The way that debates work is typically one person makes a claim, another person might make

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:54.940
a counterclaim, and then the different people debating need to actually provide logic, reason,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.360
evidence for their claims.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.560
Now, as it turns out, my claims, I can back up.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.680
I can go to the Bible.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.860
I can show you where it contradicts itself.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.880
I can go to the Bible.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.400
I can show you where it says Jesus fulfilled prophecies that he never actually fulfilled.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.860
I can back up my claims.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.360
All I'm asking you is, would you like me to back up my claims, or are you afraid of me

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.040
actually doing that and proving you wrong?

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:28.950
If I surprisingly crumble every last one of your claims to dust, what are you going to

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:29.430
do then?

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.590
Are you just going to mute me and cut me off?

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.990
Not even close to worried about it.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.430
You're not worried about it.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.750
I asked you what you're going to do, because these people need to know, because then you're

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.870
going to gaslight them and say that some shit is going on that isn't going on.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.730
You're not going to panic and mute me?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.390
No.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.390
Only if you-

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.290
All right, go through your-

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.230
Only if-

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.390
Go through your dumb ass shit.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.810
Only if you continue-

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.970
Let's go.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.130
That's the only reason why you're getting muted.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:54.750
You know that, right?

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:55.370
Oh, okay.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:55.870
See?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.330
You see what he's going to use?

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.330
You see what he's going to use?

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:03.970
So, just so you're aware, you're the reason you keep getting muted, not me.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.570
You're getting muted because you're the one being rude.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.510
You're the one over-talking everybody.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.870
You're the one that can't hold an adult conversation.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.550
All you actually have to do is behave like an adult, and I wouldn't mute you.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.210
In fact, I don't want to mute you.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:26.490
I would prefer to not mute you, but I can't do that because every time I talk, you talk,

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.250
which is why-

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:27.410
You're full of shit.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.690
Which is why you keep getting muted, and you're doing it right now.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.030
You're still doing it as-

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:32.610
You can see.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.390
Everyone-

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:38.990
As I'm explaining to you why you're getting muted, you're doing the thing that I said

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.110
is going to get you muted.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:42.890
Okay.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.890
Okay.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.590
So, now, I would love to take turns.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.550
I have no problems taking turns.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.910
The problem is, I sense that you don't want to take turns talking.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.520
Bro, I'm on the spectrum, and you're taking so much fucking time, bro.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:57.960
Just-

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.780
Well, first of all-

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.860
Let's hear these claims that are so wonderful.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.420
Being on the spectrum doesn't have anything to do with your bad behavior.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.200
My son is heavily-

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.320
Are you on the spectrum?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.500
My son is on the spectrum, and he doesn't behave like you.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.580
And my son is a level three on the spectrum, which is as high as it goes.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:15.940
Okay.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.520
Well, I was born in 80-

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.000
The problem isn't that you're on the spectrum.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.840
The problem is that you're full of yourself, and you can't actually behave like an adult.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.460
That's why-

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.680
You're behaving the way that you behave.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.460
I work with quite a few people that are on the spectrum, because I'm an electrical engineer,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.320
and I work with a bunch of engineers.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.980
And as it turns out, engineering, people in engineering are quite likely, quite often,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.880
on the spectrum.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.220
So, being on the spectrum doesn't mean that you have to be a piece of shit, because the

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.400
people that I work with are delightful, and I know for a fact that a couple of them

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.100
are on the spectrum.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.400
So, would you like to first talk about how the Bible contains contradictions?

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.920
Is that an easy place to start?

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.620
Sure.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.640
Okay.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.660
Is it your belief that the Bible contains contradictions?

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.560
Yes or no?

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.380
No.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.240
Okay.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.700
Does the Bible even contain one contradiction?

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.460
No.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.300
Okay.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:22.540
Now, if I did show you a contradiction, this is a hypothetical, if I did show you a contradiction,

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.320
what would it mean?

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.320
I would probably be able to tell you how that's not a contradiction, and then you would say

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.960
some bullshit about how I'm wrong about that.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.040
That wasn't my analogy.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.800
My analogy said, if I did show you a true contradiction, what would it mean?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.560
Okay.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.920
Clearly, I'm going to have to break out of your analogy if I'm going to show you something

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.600
you've never seen.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:44.940
Nope.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.480
Wrong again.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.240
Okay.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.620
Well, then I guess where you're not allowed to end your stream forever, I guess.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.400
So, my analogy-

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.060
That makes sense.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.020
My analogy includes the fact that I showed you a bona fide contradiction.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.020
I'm saying, if I did indeed show you a true contradiction, what would it mean about the Bible?

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.660
First of all, you've got to look at every translation, because translations are tricky.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.420
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.660
Do you know Greek and Hebrew?

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.960
I know my way around a translation.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:16.580
Oh.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.200
That's another thing you learn with a master's in English.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.780
You know research pretty good.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.640
You're doing a lot of writing, a lot of papers, a lot of language learning.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.160
Did you learn the original languages?

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.040
I learned many languages.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.440
I understand how languages work.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.280
Did you learn how to read Greek and Hebrew?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.160
Do you know why they tell you to do that?

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.300
It's crazy that you can't actually say yes or no.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:37.760
Because they don't have English degrees.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.580
Answer the question.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.460
Do you know Greek and Hebrew?

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.600
You know why I can't?

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.300
You know why I can't?

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.800
Because you have already established in your mind that that is the height.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:52.660
All I want to know is if you can read the original languages that the Bible was written in, because

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.140
that seems to be the most important thing.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:00.380
If you think something's mistranslated, what we should be doing is going back and seeing

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.840
what was in the original language.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.960
So I'm asking you, do you know the original languages?

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.280
Everything I don't know can be found.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.200
Google Translate exists, and also there's Bible apps.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.020
I don't know why she can't answer a question.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.600
All I asked was whether or not you know the original languages.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.820
All you have to say is either yes or no.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.570
I'll answer your question when you answer me if you're capable of free.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.410
Wrong again.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.010
I asked you a question already.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.250
I'm not going to let you run from it.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.230
It's an easy question.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.870
The question is, do you actually know Greek and Hebrew?

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.670
It's just yes or no.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.210
You're not going to let me run from it?

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.270
It's yes or no.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.690
It's an irrelevant question.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.430
It's yes or no.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.350
It's irrelevant.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.130
It's yes or no.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.930
Okay, do I know the Greek or Hebrew?

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.650
I know enough.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:54.850
I study it quite a bit.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.110
I know some words, actually.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.470
Okay, so you know a couple words.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.870
I can't have a hold of conversation, no.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:04.790
But I have studied the Greek and the Hebrew, and it's look-up-able for fuck's sake.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.090
It's such a thing as a concordance.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.850
Do you know what the aorist conjugation is in Greek?

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.050
The what?

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.190
The aorist conjugation.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.230
The aorist?

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.730
Yeah.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.630
Is that the verb to be?

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.590
No.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.710
What is it?

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.770
It's a form of conjugation in Greek, so you don't know Greek.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:24.990
Cool.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:25.310
All right.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.710
An aorist conjugation.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.190
No, no, no.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:27.770
Excuse me.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.670
All conjugations are the same.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.330
No, they're not.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:31.570
All conjugations.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.330
Yes, they are.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.050
You got a first person, second person, third person.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.490
Wrong.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.650
Yes, they are, bro.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.990
Wrong again.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.750
Yes, they are.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:38.110
You're wrong.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.350
And you can look it up.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.810
You're wrong.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.830
You can look up anything.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:42.790
No, I'm not wrong.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.110
I have a degree.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.390
I've studied the-

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.930
You don't have a degree in Greek.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:53.430
If you did, you would know that the aorist conjugation is a way of conjugating verbs where

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.190
the action of the verb happened in the past but is actually ongoing.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:03.130
So it's a past tense verb that is still continuing, right?

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.790
That's an aorist verb in the Greek.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:11.750
I asked you that because it's a very common way of forming verbs in Greek, and I'm just

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:17.290
curious if you actually know any Greek or if you just learned a word once and now you

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.090
think you know Greek.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.790
Learned a word once.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.750
I just told you I have a degree in English.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.770
All you're doing is describing-

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:25.450
But not in Greek.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:25.690
Okay.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.170
And you don't know any Hebrew either.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.450
I'm only going to ask you about Hebrew verbal stems.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.850
That'd be a complete waste.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.270
Okay, so now let's talk about the actual-

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.070
You're acting, you're acting like-

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.790
So let's talk about the actual contradiction.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.810
So what I'd like you to do is open your Bible and go to 1 Chronicles 21.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.510
Can you do that?

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.130
He's doing some illusionist bullshit on y'all.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.630
What?

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.390
Where is it at?

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.110
They're watching you crash out right now.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.130
It's 1 Chronicles 21.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.190
Yeah, because you're a liar.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.670
Just go ahead and turn to 1 Chronicles 21.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.450
And the only people that know are you and me.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.750
No, you don't know anything.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.330
You're the Dunning-Kruger effect, remember?

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.850
Just turn to 1 Chronicles 21.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.350
We'll actually get to the point.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.390
1 Chronicles 21?

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.990
Oh yeah, like you understand anything about the Old Testament.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.910
We'll be here for a while, I'm sure.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.450
I literally have two degrees in biblical studies, both of them focusing in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.890
I said, like I said, like I said.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.850
So between the two of us, I would say one of us is actually prepared to read the Old Testament.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.490
Between the two of us.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.010
So 1 Chronicles 21, are you there yet?

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.470
Let me know.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.940
Yeah, you're right, Mason.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.760
She's new here.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.400
She don't know.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.480
She's going to find out today.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.300
Let me know when you get to about verse 11 in 1 Chronicles 21.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.140
It's going to be a wild night.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.600
I was going to go to bed at midnight, but I'm having so much fun, I might stay on all

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.340
night with Hadassah.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.600
Hadassah, did you find the verse yet?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.720
Do you know where Chronicles is?

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.300
Or do you have to look at like the reference guide at the beginning of the Bible?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.120
Maybe God will give you a prophecy about how to find it.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.750
She's probably still yelling.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.030
She don't even know she's muted right now.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.930
You never did tell me from where in 1 Chronicles.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:21.950
I did, 21.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.810
1 Chronicles what?

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.470
21-11.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.610
1 Chronicles 21-11.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.270
Mm-hmm.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:29.230
Okay.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.600
All right, who's reading it?

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.480
Am I reading what?

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.400
I'll read it for you.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.680
In fact, I'll put it on the screen.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:38.500
Okay.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.680
It says, Gad, that's the prophet.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.800
It didn't say God.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.100
It said, Gad came to David and said to him, thus saith the Lord, take your choice.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:51.420
It says, three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.840
of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of the Lord pestilence on the

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.080
land.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:03.080
So Gad is giving three options to David for a punishment.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.900
And the first option is three years of famine.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.120
The second option is three months of devastation.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.460
And the third option is three days of pestilence.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.220
Follow so far?

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.220
Yes.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:17.820
Okay.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:24.260
Now, the parallel story, because this story is told twice, is going to be in the book

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:24.760
of Samuel.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.760
If you go to 2 Samuel 24, we get the identical same story, except something is different.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.040
Let me see if you can find it.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.780
In verse 12, he says,

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.280
Go and say to David, thus saith the Lord, three things I offer you.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.900
Choose one of them, and I will do it to you.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:45.100
So Gad came to David and told him, and he asked him, Shall seven years of famine come

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.040
to you on your land, or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.140
you, or shall there be three days pestilence in your land?

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.300
Did you spot the difference?

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.260
Uh-huh.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.020
Yeah.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:56.900
Where's the difference?

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.340
The one says three and one says seven.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:00.860
Yeah.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.920
Are those the same numbers?

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:03.860
No.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.920
So then, was it three or seven?

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.130
I don't know.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.690
I'd have to do some further research on it.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.490
Sounds to me like it's just a contradiction.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:14.810
It might be.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.170
It's a big-ass book, and all of it intersects.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:19.670
I know.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.850
That's why I know it's a contradiction.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.350
No, you don't know that it's a contradiction.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:24.970
I do.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.170
No, you don't.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.830
I do, because three and seven are different numbers.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.530
Oh, my God.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.730
Let's throw the whole fucking book out.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.150
Oh, this is only-

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:35.870
That's really responsible.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.190
This is literally just a tip of the iceberg.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:38.790
You want to keep going?

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.830
Sure.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:41.810
All right.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:42.850
Well, today, you're going to learn.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.450
Mark chapter two.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:45.690
I assume you know where Mark is.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:45.850
No, no, no.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.810
Actually, yeah, you're right.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.890
I am, because when I come back and look up every last one of these and end your fucking

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.690
channel, I'm going to fucking spit on your grave.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.510
Can't wait.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.670
I literally cannot wait for you to come back.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.770
I know that you can't wait.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.130
I know that you can't wait.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:04.030
Give me your bad apologetics, because I already know all the apologetical answers for this.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:04.990
My bad apologetics, bro.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.650
I said I'm a prophet.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.870
And they don't work here.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.310
I said I'm a prophet.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.250
Mark chapter two, verse 26.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:11.670
First Chronicles.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.450
First one was, wait.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.090
First Chronicles 21, 11.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.510
Okay.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:15.610
And then this one is what?

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.090
The other one was in 2 Samuel.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.310
2 Samuel.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:20.890
Let's see.

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.450
What chapter were we in 2 Samuel?

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:24.190
It was going to be chapter 24.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.920
Maybe you can ask God for guidance.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.780
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.400
It's interesting that I bet your research is going to be looking stuff up on the internet

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.080
and not getting revelation from God.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:42.980
I'm willing to bet that.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.040
But anyways, let's go to Mark chapter two.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.820
And if I find some shit, then what happens?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.800
Nothing's going to happen.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.980
I already know what shit you're going to find.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.520
I already read it.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.260
What do you mean?

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:52.960
What?

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:53.400
Okay.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.360
Fine.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:54.760
Keep going.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.560
Listen, you go and go to ApologeticsPress or GotQuestions.org, come back with the bad

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.220
answer, and I'll cook you on your bad answer just like I'm cooking you now.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.640
So Mark chapter two.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.540
No, you're not going to cook me on shit.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.080
Yeah, I will.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.340
Go to Mark.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.420
You're going to get cooked.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.420
In your dreams.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.640
Go to Mark chapter two for me.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.420
In your dreams.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:12.760
What?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.500
Go to Mark chapter two.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.400
No, you said 2 Samuel 24.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.280
We're already done with it.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.500
And then you didn't say anything else.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.000
No.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.580
What did we say?

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.900
It's already done.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.240
Three and seven are different.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.300
No, that was 1 Chronicles 21-11.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.940
Which is a contradiction of 1 Samuel 24.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.100
Or 2 Samuel 24.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.480
Oh, those are addressing the same thing.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600
It's the same story.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.460
Two different authors, different details.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:38.760
Hold up.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.780
2 Samuel 24.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.440
2 Samuel 24.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.860
He wasn't king in 2 Samuel.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:44.720
Yeah, it was.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.220
Hold up.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:45.740
Hold up.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.400
Sure was.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.800
2 Samuel 24.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.080
Literally the same channel.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.000
Let me just double check.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.320
Let me just double check.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.540
Because you didn't just say anything fucking way.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.440
Literally the same story.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.120
Okay.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.600
Put those two chapters.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.440
It says, David enrolls the fighting men.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.480
Hold up.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.620
Put the two chapters side by side.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.480
There's the same story.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.220
David enrolls the fighting men.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.240
You're right.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:11.660
Okay.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:12.760
Freed.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.720
She was supposed to be smarter, right?

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.300
I expected better from a Christian being that they're supposed to be smarter than us

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:18.780
atheists.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.460
This does not indicate smartness.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.860
You're not getting me on that showy bullshit.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.140
It seems to me like you're not very smart if you don't know that these are the same chapters.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:28.980
You're not very smart.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.380
This ginormous book.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.060
Three and seven is all you got.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.700
Two numbers.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.140
I got a lot more than that.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:37.980
I got so much.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.840
Oh, you got seven typos where it said comb instead of brush.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.220
Nope.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.080
Not even close.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.340
I've got so much more.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:45.800
All right.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.220
If you can actually get the mental.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.020
The second one is just a shadow of the first one.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:55.060
If you can actually muster the mental fortitude to keep forging on, you can see some more.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.190
Keep going.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.090
Okay.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.090
Did you find Mark chapter two yet?

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.270
No.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.830
What is it?

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.130
Go ahead and turn to Mark chapter two.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.430
Mark chapter two, the whole chapter?

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.210
What the fuck?

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:09.790
Verse 26.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.610
What's the verse?

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:11.550
Verse 26.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:12.690
2, 26.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.440
Okay.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:18.800
Okay.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.580
Mark 2, 26.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.280
Now, Jesus is speaking here.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.960
Y'all love to say this is like, this is, this should be, none of these should even count.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.240
These are eyewitness accounts.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.560
This is so freaking stupid.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.620
Mark wasn't an eyewitness.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.520
Mark was the cousin of Barnabas.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.300
You think Mark was a disciple?

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.360
Mark wrote it.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.140
No, Mark wrote it on behalf of Peter.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.700
Oh, where's that in the Bible?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.720
It's Peter's.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.120
That's known just like you pulled out that Barnabas shit.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.140
That's not in the Bible.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:46.420
Yeah.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.320
Colossians chapter four.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.180
Mark would read it for you?

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.850
You haven't read this book, have you?

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.590
Okay, what does that have to do with anything?

00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.850
You have no idea what's in this book.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:00.230
No, Mark.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.010
No, listen.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.710
You don't have to perform for everybody.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:04.070
That's crazy.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:04.510
That's crazy to me.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.750
You don't have to perform everybody.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.070
All right.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.150
Mark was writing on behalf of Peter.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.190
Everybody knows that.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:10.670
No, they don't.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.490
That's Peter's.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:11.950
I disagree.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:12.710
That's Peter's point.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.170
Of course everybody knows that.

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.610
No, they don't.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:15.650
Yes, they do.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.090
I disagree.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.890
Yes, they do.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.350
I disagree.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.890
Okay, well, they should because it's old news.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.710
It's not old news.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:22.490
They only started changing that shit.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.690
It's mythology.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.350
They started changing that shit since the internet.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:25.630
Nah, it's just mythology.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.350
No, it's not fucking mythology.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.270
How old are you?

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:29.990
It's mythology.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.190
Mark chapter two.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.710
How old are you?

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.010
I mean, if you want to read the book, we can read the book.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:35.430
It sounds like you're afraid to read the book.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:36.430
It's not.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.530
You know why it's mythology?

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:38.450
Because it's true, bro.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.470
It sounds to be that you're afraid.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.290
Why would they lie about it?

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.330
It sounds like you're afraid to read the book.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.850
You want to read it?

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.890
I'm not afraid to read the book.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.130
It's on the screen right now.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.910
I know about what Mark is.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.450
You don't.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:49.990
Hadassah, read what's on the screen.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.390
Yes, I do.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.430
Read what's on the screen.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.810
How he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the presence,

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.310
which is not lawful for any but the priest to eat.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.510
He gave some to his companions.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.030
And who's this about?

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.350
Do you know what's happening in Mark chapter two?

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.450
David.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:06.190
Okay, right.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:12.330
Now, do you believe that when David went into the temple or the shrine at Nob and ate the

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.150
showbread that Abiathar was the high priest?

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:16.730
Yeah.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.170
Oh, really?

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.450
Okay.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.610
Do you know where that story comes from?

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.980
Somewhere in Samuel.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.500
Yeah, because I'm typing it on the screen.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.280
1 Samuel 21.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.980
All right, so now.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.520
No, I know.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.200
I read my Bible.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:31.880
Oh, I'm sure.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:32.860
You've demonstrated.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.480
I love this ass.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.220
You've demonstrated that so well to us.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.700
I read it for funsies.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.880
David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech, and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.020
and said to him, why are you alone and no one with you?

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.980
And then what happens?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.160
He has a whole conversation with Ahimelech, and Ahimelech gives him the showbread.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.660
He says, give me five loaves of bread and whatever is here.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.060
And the priest answered, David, I have no ordinary bread at hand, only the holy bread.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.100
So, actually, who's the high priest here?

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.000
It says Ahimelech.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:02.640
Oh, shit.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.140
Is Ahimelech Abiathar?

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:07.790
I don't know.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.450
No.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.350
No, they're not.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:10.670
They're different people.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.160
Okay.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.100
Which means—

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.360
That doesn't change the point of anything.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.100
That means Mark chapter 2, verse 26 is wrong.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.340
They quoted the Old Testament wrong.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.280
How about that, then?

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.200
I love it.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:28.980
Matthew 22.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.920
We'll do it right now.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.800
We'll do Luke 4 and Matthew 22.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.420
And shit, well, there's even a passage in Matthew where he misquotes Psalm 8.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.320
But my favorite is Matthew 22, if you go down to verse 41.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.260
It says, while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them this question,

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.000
what do you think of the Messiah?

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.740
Whose son is he?

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.580
They said to him, the son of David.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:58.520
And he said to them, how is it, then, that David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying,

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.260
the Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet?

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.060
What is Jesus saying?

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.320
Why is he quoting Psalm 110 here?

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.040
Because he's asking who the Lord is in the sentence.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:13.940
Right.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:14.920
But what's he saying?

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.960
And how can it be his son?

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.900
What is he suggesting about the Messiah?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.660
He's suggesting that the label is not correct.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.840
He's suggesting that the Messiah is not just the son of David.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.120
The Messiah is also on par with God.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.200
Right?

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.140
No, I don't think that's what that means.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:46.960
I think that means that he is questioning the son of David moniker.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.800
He's saying, why do we say, why are we saying this?

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.020
And the scripture says this.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.060
So, they were calling him son of David.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.840
So, Jesus is making something very interesting here.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.160
He's just saying, if David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.420
He's just saying that the Messiah is going to be Lord, right?

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.580
Right.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:08.220
Okay.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:15.280
So, do you believe then that when Jesus is quoting this text, like, I should go back to

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.260
Psalm 110, and I should see David saying, the Lord said to my Lord, right?

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:24.900
Sure.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.400
Have you read Psalm 110?

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.720
A couple of times, probably, yeah.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.200
Interesting.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.720
It's a big book.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.460
I read it.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.060
I read it.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.280
It's part of my life.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.100
So, I don't have a stick up my ass.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.040
I don't have a medal for how many hours I've spent reading the Bible, like some people.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.220
Odd for a prophetess.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.820
So, Psalm 110 starts out with, Neum Yahweh, which means an oracle of Yahweh.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:53.900
It doesn't actually—

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.300
Oh!

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.540
Slam dunk.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.620
You guys are idiots.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.440
I don't think you actually know what I just said.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.920
So, it doesn't start out saying that the Lord said to my Lord.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:09.840
It says, Neum Yahweh, La'adini, which means an oracle of Yahweh to my master.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.200
That's what that means.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:17.300
This is clearly an oracle from somebody in King David's court about King David, which

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.860
is why he literally says, sit at my right hand until I make thy enemies by the footstool,

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.600
the exact promise made to David that came true in 1 Kings chapter 5.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.720
So, this is not David even speaking.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.060
That is somebody's interpretation.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:31.920
No, it's not.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.020
That's someone's interpretation.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:33.620
Nope.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.600
If Jesus is using that—

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:35.820
You're wrong.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.260
Jesus is using—Jesus himself is using that as reference to himself.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.600
Do you know why he's wrong?

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.440
Oh, Jesus is wrong.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:43.880
Do you want—

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.340
Oh, shit.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.000
Okay, you're that deluded.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.700
You're delulu.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.760
Do you want to know why he's wrong?

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.780
Why is he wrong?

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.500
Because he doesn't know how to read Hebrew, or whoever wrote the Gospel of Matthew didn't

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.280
know how to read Hebrew.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.340
They're quoting it from the Greek.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.820
Do you know what the Greek text says?

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.990
What does it say?

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.330
It says, the Lord said to my Lord.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:05.730
Do you want to know why it says that?

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.490
Why does it say that?

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:14.110
Because just in—like our English Bibles, rather than saying the name of Yahweh, quite

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:19.310
often, they would say the Lord instead of Yahweh to protect the divine name.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:26.130
So, in the Greek text, it literally says, ha-kirios, the Lord said to my Lord.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.470
And it sounds—if you're reading that, it sounds like it's talking about two different

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.870
lords.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:36.030
But when you read it in the original Hebrew, it's clear that there are not two lords.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:42.710
There is an oracle of Yahweh, to a lord, to the master.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.570
Adonai just means my master.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.070
It's what they called the king.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.730
Adonai is the name of God.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:51.710
It's plural.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.110
What are you talking about?

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.390
It doesn't say Adonai, and Adonai is not plural.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:58.370
Well, what does it say then?

00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.970
It says Adonai.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.830
Adonai is a different vowel pointing.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.720
Okay, so I don't agree with your interpretation.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.280
That's just an interpretation.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:13.980
Well, then—

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.400
First of all—

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.080
Show me where strong.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.740
First of all.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.640
First of all.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.380
Show me where strong.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.380
Listen.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:18.880
Listen.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.300
So, first of all—

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.000
Did you know that—

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.300
Like I said.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.760
Did you know that—

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.560
Are we going to have an actual conversation?

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.720
Not if you keep talking.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.260
Because I don't think you're capable of that.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.880
I don't think you're capable of that.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:29.940
Does the word na'um—

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.640
You got me going down your funnel.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.680
You got me going down your weird-ass funnel thinking this is important.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.100
What does—

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.300
None of this changes—

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.120
Let's try this again.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.560
Does the word na'um—

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.020
Is that a verb or a noun?

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.580
Do you know?

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.580
What?

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.140
Is what?

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.580
Is it a verb or a noun?

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.060
Is what a verb or a noun?

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.060
The word I have highlighted, na'um.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.680
Is that a verb or a noun?

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.160
What does it mean?

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.620
I'm asking you.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.800
Is it a verb or a noun?

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:02.260
I don't know what the translation of the word is, so I wouldn't know.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.140
Okay, it's a noun.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.540
It's an oracle of Yahweh, na'um Yahweh.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.620
You do know that Bible apps have Hebrew on them.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.140
I know.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.800
I would click on it right—

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.620
Which is why I went to school to learn Hebrew, so I wouldn't have to do dumb things like use

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.260
websites.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.660
I went to school to learn something that you can just look up on an app.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.420
I know, yeah.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:28.920
So congrats, bro.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:29.200
I know.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.000
You went to learn English.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.300
You went to learn something that I learned as a fifth grader.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.140
That's what you did.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.740
I went to school, and I actually learned the original languages and history of the Bible.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:41.300
You're arrogant.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.480
I'm not arrogant.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.140
I'm just right.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.640
So the fact of the matter is—

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.860
Those were my electives, too.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.760
Na'um is a verb.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.080
Those were my electives, too.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.020
Na'um wasn't a verb.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.460
It's actually a noun, right?

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.000
Nothing.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.440
All you're saying is gobbledygook, bro, and I know it.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.560
It's not gobbledygook.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.480
Yes, it is.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.020
Do you think—

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.140
It doesn't prove—

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.180
Do you think that verbs and nouns are the same?

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.200
Are you an asshole and a cocksucker?

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.780
It sounds to me like you're incapable of answering the question.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.540
Do you think that verbs and nouns are the same?

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.280
Do you think that your arrogant act is fooling any fucking body?

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:25.720
It sounds to me like you're feeling a little hot under the collar, and you're incapable of engaging with the dialogue, which is why you're crashing out like a toddler.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:26.620
Because it's free time.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:32.520
So the question was, do you think that verbs and nouns mean the same thing?

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.940
Because if this is—

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.880
Your time—

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.580
If, in fact, this is a noun—

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.740
This time's coming to—

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.460
If, in fact, this is a noun, it doesn't say that God spoke.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.160
It doesn't say that Yahweh spoke.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.000
It actually is announcing—

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.720
It's over with.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.260
It's actually announcing—

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:49.900
Real Christians have—

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.040
It's actually announcing something.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.380
So the question is, what is it—

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.960
Real Christians have real power.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.860
What is it announcing?

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.400
I don't need these stupid-ass arguments.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.420
They're stupid.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.520
You've got real power.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.120
Oh, shit.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.060
What power do you have?

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.800
Show me your power.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.340
You're an asshole.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.140
Show me the power.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:14.220
I got the power to see through your bullshit and know that it has nothing to do with the truth.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.180
The people are thirsty for someone who's going to give them something real.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.520
And your shit is over.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.960
It sounds like you're incapable of doing that.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.500
You copied.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.880
All you did was copy the Pharisaical Christian model.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.020
Make it secular.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.440
I'm not impressed.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.620
It's retarded.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.540
And the Lord's coming for it.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:37.860
The prophet Hadassah is debuting today because it's Easter, Passover, and 420.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:38.640
What's good?

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.680
If you're hearing my voice and it's 420, smoke your shit.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.320
Find the Lord because he's out there.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.040
Call in the Lord.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.500
I'm talking about Jesus.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.140
Sounds to me like you're out there.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.180
And I don't know if you know how this platform works.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:58.660
But this platform is certainly not a place where you get to preach.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:03.480
So the question is whether or not you want to engage in some dialogue.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.820
I'm more than happy to engage in some dialogue.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.240
Cut out the middleman.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.700
Go find the Lord.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.540
Go find Jesus.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.800
I'm going to get you.

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.160
That's what a Christian is.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.360
What's good?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.860
What's good?

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.660
The Lord is good.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.220
He loves you.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.660
Fuck this guy.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.640
That's all she got.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:25.980
He's a liar.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:26.920
That's all she got.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.100
He's it.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.800
He's got pride.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:30.580
Praise.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.200
Pride.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:32.080
Praise Jebus.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.620
Pride is what caused this whole thing.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.380
Let me know when you're when you're done.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.620
I'll call.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.940
I'll call your mama and have her come change your diapy.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.320
Pride is what caused.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.880
It's what caused.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.720
Pride is what.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:47.820
The whole thing.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.020
That's why.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.620
Well, I mean, at least she was fun.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.460
Well, I mean, we'll we'll give her.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.300
We'll give her that.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.320
She was fun, at least.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:56.420
at least.
