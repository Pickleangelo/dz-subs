1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
Guest: Can you hear me?

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,960
Justin: Yeah, I can hear you.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,760
Guest: Okay, so when I prove you wrong, I want you to say to your life, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,360
I won't.

5
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,640
All right?

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,260
You won't.

7
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,840
Perfect, all right.

8
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,800
I know.

9
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,980
Justin: Every Christian I talk to is the only Christian doing it right, and I'm sure you're about

10
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,640
to crash out in like five seconds.

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,140
So are you at least 18?

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,540
Guest: Yes.

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,580
Justin: Fantastic.

14
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,400
And do you know that the Bible condones slavery?

15
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,280
Guest: No it doesn't.

16
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,140
So let's go back to Genesis chapter 15 verses 13 to 16.

17
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,500
Justin: This is going to be painful, so I'll just read it for you since you haven't read it.

18
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,380
It's okay.

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,360
I got it right here.

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,860
I read it.

21
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm sure you have.

22
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,220
Fantastic.

23
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,160
As for your male and female slaves you may have, it is from the nations around you that

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,920
you may acquire male and female slaves.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,580
You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families

26
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,320
who are with you who have been born in your land.

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,240
They may be your property.

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,640
You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit to

29
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,180
as property.

30
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,720
Now, what do you call it when you own another human being as property?

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,460
Slavery.

32
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,600
Oh, slavery.

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,900
The Bible condones slavery.

34
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,340
So now I want you to issue an apology.

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,860
Guest: No, let me finish speaking though.

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Justin: Oh, let me, we'll try this again.

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
And does owning another human being make them a slave?

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,460
Yes.

39
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,060
Okay, did God just say, these are the slaves you may own?

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Guest: Okay, can I finish speaking?

41
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,160
Justin: Did God just say, these are the slaves?

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,220
Did God say, did God say, did God say you can own these slaves?

43
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,570
Guest: He said it for a reason.

44
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,570
Justin: Did he say, did he say you can do it?

45
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,710
Guest: Yes, for a reason.

46
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,370
Justin: Okay, so then God condones slavery.

47
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,350
That's literally what I said.

48
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,550
the Christian God condones.

49
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,370
For a reason.

50
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,990
Thank you.

51
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,010
Okay, so now I want you to issue an apology before we move on to your next talking point.

52
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,110
Guest: Can we, okay, I'll say sorry for that, yes, God does condone for a reason.

53
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,710
Justin: Fantastic.

54
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,110
So now we got to talking point number two, God allows slavery and you think you've got

55
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,950
a good reason for it.

56
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,070
Guest: For a reason, for a reason.

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,850
Yes, for a reason.

58
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,230
By the way, can we agree that he's speaking to the Israelites in that verse, yes or no?

59
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,930
Justin: Yeah, God is speaking to Moses in order to speak to the Israelites.

60
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,710
Guest: To the Israelites, perfect, all right.

61
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,670
Justin: Go to Genesis 15.

62
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,010
Genesis 15 is going to cook you, you're not going to like this at all.

63
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,530
Guest: 13 to 16.

64
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,230
13 to 16.

65
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,290
You're going to hate this.

66
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,090
All right, perfect, all right.

67
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,730
Justin: This is not going to go the way you think it is.

68
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:32,130
As the sun was going down and a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a deep and terrifying

69
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,770
darkness descended upon him, then the Lord said to Abram, know this for certain that

70
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,190
your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs and they shall be slaves there.

71
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,350
They shall be oppressed for 400 years, although it's technically 430 years.

72
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,350
Guest: Yep, 435 if you want to be exact, but he's talking about the Israelites, they're going

73
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,690
Justin: to be.

74
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,250
Actually, I think it's 430.

75
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,710
I mean, I'm pretty sure it is.

76
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,450
Guest: But he's speaking to the, he's saying that the Israelites are going to be enslaved, correct

77
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:04,870
or yes?

78
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,270
He's speaking about the Israelites, correct or not?

79
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,990
Justin: He's talking about the Israelites serving in Egypt.

80
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,370
Guest: Perfect, okay, then when we go back to the same verse you were talking about previous,

81
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,350
he's allowing the Israelites to have slaves up to six years.

82
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,650
Justin: Yeah, it says the time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years.

83
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,050
Alright, apology, apology number two, let's have it.

84
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,850
Guest: Okay, I'm sorry for that, yeah, 430, I'm sorry, wow.

85
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,210
Justin: Fantastic, okay, alright, now back to your bad talking point.

86
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,170
So what about Exodus?

87
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,210
Guest: So back to your verse, correct?

88
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,350
Justin: Which one?

89
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,390
Guest: It's the previous one he gave me, correct?

90
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,510
Justin: Leviticus 25.

91
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,010
Guest: Yes.

92
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,850
Alright, what about it?

93
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,250
He's telling the Israelites that they have the right to own a slave up to six years and

94
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,650
free them the seventh year, yes or no?

95
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,370
Justin: Citation needed, you're lying.

96
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,870
Guest: Go back to the verse then, go back to the verse.

97
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,650
Justin: I got it right here, you're not going to like it.

98
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,270
I love how confident these people come in having not read the book.

99
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,330
Alright, so show me in Leviticus 25 where it says anything about going free in the seventh

100
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,850
year.

101
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,910
Guest: Here.

102
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,770
Justin: You're confusing Exodus 21 with Leviticus 25 by the way, just be clear.

103
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,250
Guest: Give me one sec, I was eating.

104
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,820
Justin: It's wild how often Christians get spanked on this topic considering they've got the

105
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,940
power of the Holy Spirit.

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,720
Why is the Holy Spirit so weak?

107
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,580
Guest: Go to Exodus 21.

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,660
Justin: I told you, you're confusing Exodus 21 and Leviticus 25, I already got it, fantastic.

109
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,800
This is going to cook you.

110
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,560
Guest: No it isn't.

111
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,100
Justin: Yeah, you're not going to like this at all.

112
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,120
It says, when you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall go out, I'm sorry, he shall serve

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,600
you six years but in the seventh year he shall go out a free person without debt.

114
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,560
Now, what if you're a woman though?

115
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,500
Uh-huh.

116
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,120
Have you read verse 7?

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
When a man sells his daughter as a slave, yeah, she doesn't get to go out.

118
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,980
And what happens if somebody is given a wife while they're in their six years of service?

119
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,820
If a master gives them a wife and she bears some sons or daughters, the wife and her

120
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:40,220
children shall be her masters and he shall go out alone because they are permanent slaves.

121
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
Guest: Okay, now go to verse 10, read verse 10.

122
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,120
Justin: If he takes another wife to himself, so now we've got polygamy, if he takes another wife

123
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,400
to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife.

124
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,620
Yeah, if he takes a wife, because you're allowed to take multiple wives.

125
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,500
Guest: So if you, if, I'm going to repeat that again, it says if he takes another wife, so if he

126
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,560
takes another wife, he shall not diminish food, clothing, and uh, right, yeah, right?

127
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:14,980
Of who?

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Which is implying of the woman that was sold.

129
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,340
No.

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,120
Justin: Which means the woman.

131
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,780
Wrong.

132
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,040
Wrong.

133
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Yes, that's what it says.

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,020
Guest: How's it wrong?

135
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,580
Justin: That, you're not to diminish the woman's sustenance while she is a concubine.

136
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,620
Just like everything else, you haven't actually read the text, we'll read it for you.

137
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,960
When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,720
If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,240
let her be redeemed.

140
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,940
Why does it say that he has designated her for himself?

141
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,390
Why does it say that he doesn't answer my question?

142
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,370
Why does it say that he designated this woman?

143
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,250
What's it mean when it says that she's been designated?

144
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,850
Guest: If you go back to the old Hebrew text, it says serve.

145
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,110
Justin: What's it mean, Deuteronomy is not the old Hebrew text, Exodus is older.

146
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,310
Guest: I'm talking about Exodus, I'm talking about the verse we're talking about.

147
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,970
Justin: I know, we're in Exodus, I'm asking you a question about the passage in Exodus that

148
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,210
we literally just read.

149
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,370
It says that if he designates her for himself or for the son, what does it mean to designate?

150
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,410
Guest: In the old Hebrew text of that verse, it says serve.

151
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,370
Justin: Stop saying Hebrew, you don't know Hebrew.

152
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,990
Guest: Well, if you go to blueletterbible.org, it translates it for you.

153
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,190
Justin: I actually know Hebrew, we're going to get into this.

154
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,330
Okay, so Solo says, oh jeez, if I worship this god, if I worshiped a god this bad, I'd

155
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,910
stop voting.

156
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,910
Big W Solo, I appreciate that, and I agree, I hope this guy doesn't vote.

157
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,530
All right, so the problem here is that you're interpreting the word evid or ama to mean

158
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:05,930
what?

159
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,810
Guest: Excuse me, sir, you got a…

160
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,510
Justin: Which word?

161
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,630
Evid or ama?

162
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,650
Guest: Search it up in the blue letter at Bible.org, it tells you itself.

163
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,430
Justin: I'm literally telling you what the words are.

164
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,990
A male Hebrew slave is an evid.

165
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,570
So what's your complaint with the Hebrew?

166
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,170
Guest: The lettering was changed.

167
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,330
What lettering?

168
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,150
To serve.

169
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,730
Justin: No, incorrect.

170
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,290
Guest: Search it up, you can pull it up on your screen right now.

171
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,630
Justin: And this guy is just a glutton for punishment.

172
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:50,270
All right, we're going to do Exodus 21, and we'll do, which verse do you want to read?

173
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,900
Guest: You go to 1 Timothy 1.10.

174
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,860
Justin: That's in Greek, it's not even the same book.

175
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,320
We're talking about what's happening in Exodus 21.

176
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,140
Guest: So you just want to talk about Old Testament, not New Testament?

177
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
Justin: So you're just dodging the passage.

178
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,840
You're right, if I was in this conversation and I was in your position, I would buy a

179
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,240
ticket to get the fuck out of here real fast, because you're getting absolutely roasted

180
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,580
right now.

181
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,760
This is embarrassing.

182
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,820
So we're talking about what Exodus 21 says, and you're trying to run away from it now.

183
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,820
So I want to know what in Exodus 21 gets is getting translated incorrectly.

184
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,820
Guest: Well, you're misreading it, so.

185
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,500
Justin: What am I misreading?

186
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,580
Guest: Do you keep interrupting me?

187
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,120
Can I go?

188
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,820
Justin: I asked you, you said I'm misreading.

189
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,040
I want to give me the actual text that I'm misreading.

190
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Guest: Okay, I'm giving you verses and you keep saying I'm jumping around.

191
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,640
These verses answer themselves.

192
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Justin: They don't.

193
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,540
Guest: They do.

194
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,840
Well, back then in the Bible, it states if you were in debt and you didn't have the money

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,960
to pay for it, you became a servant, which was called a slave in those days, and you

196
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,680
worked for free.

197
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,300
Justin: I'll help you out.

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,620
Do you see this?

199
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:58,880
Yes or no?

200
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,580
You're wrong.

201
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,820
I'm fixing it for you.

202
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,180
Do you see this word right here?

203
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,520
Right.

204
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,200
That's a radicalized consonant at the end.

205
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,740
This means, sorry, hold on, there we go.

206
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,940
That's actually not the right one.

207
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,220
Sorry.

208
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,240
We want this word.

209
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,160
There we go.

210
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,520
Evin.

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,660
This means a slave or a servant, right?

212
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,560
We also have the word ama in here somewhere in verse seven.

213
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,120
If we go to verse seven, we'll find a different word for a female slave.

214
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,340
Guest: But it says a servant right there.

215
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:30,800
Justin: I know.

216
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm about to help you out.

217
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,660
Just hold on tight.

218
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,480
Okay, so we have another word that we find here.

219
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,120
This is an ish for a male and a daughter, which is a bat, or if it's plural, it's going

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,800
to be different.

221
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,920
There we go.

222
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
And this is ama.

223
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,700
So this root here means a female slave.

224
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,480
This is a preposition.

225
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,580
That's not part of the word.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,140
Okay, so these are the words that we have.

227
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,140
And both of these words can mean a servant or a slave.

228
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,020
Do you know what the difference between a servant and a slave is?

229
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,180
Guest: Well, a slave doesn't get paid.

230
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,440
And what else?

231
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,880
Well, they get treated poorly.

232
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,980
Justin: No, one goes free and one doesn't go free.

233
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,420
Guest: Well, yes.

234
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,120
What I'm trying to say-

235
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,600
Justin: Fantastic.

236
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,660
In verse seven, do the female slaves get to go free?

237
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,530
Guest: If you go back to what it says-

238
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,750
Justin: In verse seven, do they get to go free?

239
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,430
It's a yes or no question.

240
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,230
Guest: It doesn't say if they get to go free.

241
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,850
Justin: It says the opposite.

242
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,510
It says they don't get to go free.

243
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,350
If you go to verse four about the woman who is given as a wife to the temporary servant,

244
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,150
do they get to go free?

245
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,230
Guest: Well, yeah.

246
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:49,910
Justin: No.

247
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,330
It says if a master gives him a wife and she bears some sons or daughters, the wife and

248
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,110
her children shall be her masters and he shall go out alone.

249
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,830
So they don't get to go free.

250
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,550
That's called slavery.

251
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,110
Imagine to have this much confidence to get up here and alive thinking you're going to

252
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,410
educate somebody and floundering in literally just three inches of water.

253
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,590
You're literally drowning in a bathtub that just got turned on.

254
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,830
We're not even deep yet.

255
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,040
Guest: It says right here, but if the servant declares, I love my master and my wife and my children

256
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,920
and do not want to go free, then his master must take him before the judges.

257
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,840
Justin: Yeah.

258
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,000
And pierce his ear.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,520
I know.

260
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
And why would he do that?

261
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
Why would he make that decision?

262
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,960
Guest: Well, that's if he wants to keep them.

263
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,680
Justin: Yes, because he doesn't want to get his family split up.

264
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,180
Yes, because these people are permanent slaves.

265
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,120
They are permanent slaves owned by the Hebrews.

266
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,580
And if somebody gives you a slave and they bear children to you, your only option, your

267
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,080
only option is to become a slave yourself.

268
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,900
You don't get to keep them.

269
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,120
Guest: You're misreading that again.

270
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Israelites were enslaved for 400 years.

271
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Justin: No, this is after.

272
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,200
This is after.

273
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,640
Guest: Yeah, this is exactly.

274
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,620
So God's telling them, you guys are, yeah, I give you my right to own slaves for six

275
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,260
years and then you can free them the seventh year.

276
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,300
Justin: Except for the women, it says, if his master gives him a wife and she she bears him sons

277
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,320
or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her masters and he will go out alone.

278
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,860
The man is leaving alone.

279
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,760
The man's wife and the children remain property of the master.

280
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,420
Guest: Yes.

281
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,860
I just said that God gave them the right to own slaves.

282
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,220
I know.

283
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,040
After they were enslaved.

284
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,080
Justin: I know.

285
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,020
Fantastic.

286
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,240
We finally got it.

287
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,680
Yes.

288
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,060
God said you could own slaves.

289
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,400
That's what background says.

290
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
The Christian God condones slavery.

291
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,460
I'm glad we can finally come to an agreement on that.

292
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,060
Guest: You're misreading it again.

293
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,020
Justin: OK.

294
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,800
What did I misread?

295
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,620
Guest: You're putting it.

296
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,060
Well, you're putting it into text like he he thought it was OK for to own slaves out

297
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,660
of the random.

298
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,640
He said you can do it.

299
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,080
He.

300
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,760
After they were enslaved for four hundred and thirty years, he said, you can do it.

301
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,700
Justin: You can own slaves.

302
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,540
He just doesn't want them to be enslaved by another nation.

303
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,210
Guest: Well, they were enslaved for four hundred and thirty years.

304
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,850
Correct or not?

305
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,150
Justin: Yes.

306
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,630
And then God say and then God saved those people.

307
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,770
Did he free all the slaves on the planet?

308
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,510
Guest: Oh, no, obviously not.

309
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,070
Justin: Oh, OK.

310
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,170
Who did he free?

311
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,390
Guest: The Israelites.

312
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,110
Justin: Did he free the slaves owned by the Israelites?

313
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,450
Guest: Well, the men, yes, but the woman.

314
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:50,870
Justin: Wrong.

315
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:51,970
No, no.

316
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,430
When they left, when they left Egypt, they already did.

317
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,630
You know that when they left Egypt, they they're some of them own slaves.

318
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,150
Guest: Well, yes.

319
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:01,730
Justin: OK.

320
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,850
Did God tell them to free the slaves?

321
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,520
Guest: It doesn't say the quote.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,980
Justin: OK, so God says you can own slaves.

323
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,880
He tells you who you can own as slaves.

324
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,280
He says you can beat your slave.

325
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,120
Never once did he say that you can't own slaves.

326
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,870
Guest: OK, and then go to Deuteronomy 11 to 14.

327
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,730
Justin: I love Deuteronomy 11.

328
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,290
I love Deuteronomy 11.

329
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,650
It's one of my favorite chapters.

330
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,430
Guest: 15 to chapter 15 verses 11 to 14.

331
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,810
Justin: Oh, you're not going to like this at all.

332
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,150
I love how they get up here thinking I haven't read it.

333
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,710
All right.

334
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,770
Deuteronomy chapter 15 11.

335
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,030
Since there will never cease to be some in need on the earth, I therefore command you

336
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,530
open your hand to the poor and needy neighbor in your land.

337
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,450
Say slave.

338
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,650
Guest: Now, read verse three.

339
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,900
Justin: Of a foreigner you may exact it, but you must remit your claim on whatever any member of

340
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,780
your community owes you.

341
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,020
This is talking about lending an interest in collecting debts.

342
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,940
So in the book of Deuteronomy and in the book of Exodus, we have laws about what kind of

343
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,880
debt and what kind of interest you can charge.

344
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,560
And as it turns out, you can lend money at an interest to foreigners, but you couldn't

345
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,960
do it to your own fellow Hebrew Israelites because God has separate laws for what you

346
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,200
can do to your brothers and separate laws to what you can do to the foreigners.

347
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,320
You can charge interest to the foreigners.

348
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,920
You can go to war and kidnap the foreigners.

349
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
You can enslave the foreigners.

350
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,020
You just can't do it to your own fellow Hebrews unless they're women, because women are just

351
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,960
as bad as foreigners.

352
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,420
Guest: It's telling you to cancel the debt.

353
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,200
Justin: It doesn't say that.

354
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,120
That's if they're your own fellow Hebrew and it's in the year of Jubilee.

355
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,520
Have you never read the book?

356
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,980
What garbage website are you pulling these talking points from?

357
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,120
Because they're all garbage talking points.

358
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,180
Guest: How are they garbage?

359
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,620
Justin: Because none of them land.

360
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,680
None of them land.

361
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,280
Do you know what the year of Jubilee is?

362
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,520
Guest: Yes, but no.

363
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,220
Justin: Okay, what happens in the year of Jubilee?

364
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,460
Guest: I disfruited, no.

365
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,300
Justin: What happens during the Jubilee?

366
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,220
Guest: Did I not disprove your point?

367
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,740
Justin: You didn't.

368
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,460
You're cooking yourself.

369
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,760
What happens during the Jubilee?

370
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,150
Guest: Because you said God said okay to all his slaves.

371
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,010
Justin: What happens during the Jubilee?

372
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,190
Guest: Don't get out of topic.

373
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,720
Justin: I'm responding to the verse you brought up, Nitwit.

374
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,710
During the year of Jubilee, what happens?

375
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Guest: And I'm not talking about that.

376
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,740
Justin: I'm talking about your-

377
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,300
You are.

378
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,240
Guest: You brought it up.

379
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,040
Statement.

380
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,100
Justin: All right, I'll break it down since you're not smart enough to gather it.

381
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,160
It says every seventh year, you shall grant remission of debts.

382
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,500
And these are debts to the Hebrews, not to the foreigners.

383
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,380
And this is the manner of remission.

384
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,340
Every creditor shall remit the claim that is held against a neighbor,

385
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,400
not exacting it because the Lord's remission has been proclaimed.

386
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,100
Of a foreigner, you may exact it.

387
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,000
You do not remit the debt of a foreigner.

388
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,030
You keep cooking yourself over and over again.

389
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,770
You must be a sadomasochist.

390
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,750
Guest: Your original claim was that it was okay for God to own slaves.

391
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,130
God said you can do it.

392
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,910
He said it to the Israelites after they were enslaved for 430 years.

393
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,210
Justin: God said you can do it.

394
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,670
I know.

395
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,270
We keep going back to this.

396
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,750
Guest: Okay, so I did refute your claim.

397
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,330
Justin: When God says you can do it, it means you can do it.

398
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,250
Guest: Well, he said under one condition.

399
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,950
If you were enslaved and you were an Israelite, which is the context,

400
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,750
you can own a slave up to six years and free them to seven.

401
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,230
Justin: Wrong.

402
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,090
We'll read it again.

403
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,150
We'll try this again.

404
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,350
The condition is that if they're a foreigner, they can be your property for life.

405
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,790
It says you may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you

406
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,890
and from their families who have been, I'm sorry,

407
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,690
family who are with you have been born in your land.

408
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,630
They may be your property.

409
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,830
You may keep them as a possession for your children after you,

410
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,210
for them to inherit as property.

411
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,290
In the Hebrew, it actually says le'olam, which means forever,

412
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,110
which is why a lot of translations say that they will be your property forever

413
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,050
or they will say they'll be your permanent property.

414
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,650
And he ran.

415
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,050
I didn't cut him, guys.

416
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,970
He cooked.

417
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,090
Imagine coming in with that amount of gusto, having not read any of it,

418
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,730
literally just Googling talking points, trying to find anything that would land.

419
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,790
These people are embarrassing.
