WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
Tay, are you at least 18?

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.040
Yes.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.100
Fantastic.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.820
Are you a theist?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.700
I am a theist.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.420
I'm a Christian, yeah.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.460
Okay, fantastic.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.720
I like how he actually just says he's a Christian rather than hiding it like the last guest.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.100
Okay, what would be your best argument or your best evidence for why the Christian God is real?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.820
Real quick, before I go into that, I just want to let you all know, I have my Bible teacher in the background.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.060
So if you hear any like voices or anything, that's just who it is.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.600
Sure.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.400
But yeah, my, I guess, best argument would be miracles and how to explain miracles.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.660
Well, I don't have to explain them because they exist in every religion and none of them are ever documented properly.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.900
So if I accepted your miracle claims, I would also have to accept the miracle claims of the Hindus and people who practice other religions.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.380
Is it your position that the Hindu miracles are real?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.400
Oh, no, sir.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.000
Okay, so then I reject Christian miracles for the same reason that you reject Hindu miracles.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.920
I reject Hindu miracles because the God that I believe in is true and he's all-powerful.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.340
Cool.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.600
What's the evidence for that?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.360
What's the evidence for God being all-powerful?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.980
Yeah.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.260
Well, you'd have to substantiate that he exists and then demonstrate that he's all-powerful.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.100
Okay, well, God exists, like I said, for one, because of miracles.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.860
But we don't have to talk about miracles.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.020
They're going to prove miracles.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.640
That's become circular now.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.280
Now, what's that?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.580
That would be circular.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.860
If you're saying God exists because miracles and miracles exist because God, that's a circular argument.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.100
Okay, well, my bad.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.560
I'll try again.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.060
Okay, so miracles, you said they weren't documented, right?

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.700
Yeah, I've never-

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.160
documented improperly?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:02.120
I've never seen a single miracle that was ever properly documented by a doctor that could ever confirm that it was, in fact, a miracle from God.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.460
There are, like, medical anomalies that exist that, again, they exist in every religion.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.820
There's every religion claims that when there's a medical anomaly that it's because their God caused it.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.400
But there's no actual, demonstrable, causal link between the medical anomaly and their deity.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.870
Okay.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:32.770
Okay, so from my worldview, like I said, in one way, yeah, whatever, miracles.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:43.690
So the reason I believe miracles are true, like you said, yeah, I haven't seen any documented miracles by doctors, like modern doctors.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.150
I haven't seen any, but I do have personal experience.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.510
I have a friend, his name is Lincoln.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250
He had a form of meningitis three times.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.570
And he survived, I guess, every single one of them.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.930
Like, and there was no, I guess, what's the right word?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.790
No lasting effects on him.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.190
Like it didn't change him or anything like that.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.630
Are you worried that people survive illnesses all the time and it's not demonstration that a God exists?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.850
Because, so, for example, like 10% statistically of all cancer cases go into spontaneous remission.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.070
But when it happens to a Christian, they automatically assume that it's because their God is real.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.910
But that's just fallacious reasoning.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.490
So, again, like you can demonstrate that there are like some weird medical oddities.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.070
But just because medical oddities exist doesn't mean that your God is real.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.950
It's still incumbent on you to demonstrate the causal link between the medical phenomenon and your deity existing.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.490
Prayer. Prayer for one.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.210
Oh, have we done any studies on prayer before?

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.330
I don't know.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.250
We have.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.670
And it comes out to a wash.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.170
People who are being prayed for have exactly the same rate of recovery and wellness as the people not being prayed for.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.690
And we've done dozens of meta-studies on this.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.230
Okay.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.210
But that doesn't deny prayer working, though.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.010
It does.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.350
Yes.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:21.450
If we pray for a group of people and then we pray or we don't pray for another group of people and they have the same statistical outcome, then, yes, it demonstrates that prayer doesn't do anything.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.610
Thank you for the jellyfish, by the way, Parker.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.530
So you're saying if prayer doesn't work for one person but it works for another, prayer doesn't work?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.080
No, for a whole group of people.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:45.040
If we've got 1,000 people and we pray for 500 of them and then we don't pray for the other 500 and those two groups of 500 have the same outcomes, that's evidence that prayer doesn't do anything.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.260
Because if praying for somebody is indistinguishable from not praying for them, then prayer is useless.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.210
Hold on.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.450
Okay.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:04.170
So in the Christian worldview, the way that prayer works, prayer doesn't always have to be answered because God doesn't need to answer our prayers.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.310
So we'll establish that first.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.850
So then prayer can't be evidence of your God if prayer doesn't actually work.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.430
So now you're just making excuses.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.130
No, no, no.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.930
So now you're just making excuses for why prayer doesn't work.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.410
I want to help you understand this point.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:31.990
If your point is that prayer is evidence that God is real but then you have to follow it up with, well, it's evidence except it doesn't actually work because God doesn't have to answer your prayer, then that's not good evidence.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.450
It either works or it doesn't.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.030
Okay, so I said God was all-powerful like the first minute I came in here.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.790
Yes.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.970
With God being all-powerful, that means he doesn't have to answer all of our prayers.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:55.050
Like, for example, if I pray that I can successfully steal that candy bar and then something happens and I don't get to steal that candy bar, that'd be like me going to blame God for committing a sin.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.490
No, not even close.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.670
Tay, you don't understand your own argument.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.370
Your argument is that prayer demonstrates the existence for God.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:13.330
You have the same exact outcomes for people not being prayed for, which means prayer literally cannot be evidence of your deity.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:23.130
And because now you know that you have the same statistical likelihood of prayer working as prayer not working, now you're making excuses for why prayer doesn't work.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.730
So if you have to make excuses for why prayer doesn't work, then you're just admitting that prayer doesn't work and it's not evidence of your God.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.930
It's not an excuse.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.650
I'm just explaining to you how it is.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.890
Does a group of people being prayed for have the same statistical outcome as people not being prayed for?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.590
Repeat that question one more time.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.970
Sorry.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.450
Thank you for the hat, Mr. Skeptic.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.970
Good to see you.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.530
Okay, so do groups of people being prayed for have the same statistical outcomes as people not being prayed for?

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.150
I do not know.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.030
They don't.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.170
They don't.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.470
So we've done dozens of meta-studies on this.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.570
There's been papers and research done on this.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.290
People that are being prayed for have no statistical advantage over people not being prayed for.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:17.370
So prayer literally cannot be evidence for God if your chances of getting better are exactly the same as the chances who aren't being prayed for.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.170
Dude, do you just want to talk to my Bible teacher?

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.030
You're welcome.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.830
I can explain this better.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.110
You're welcome to put him on.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.950
Okay.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.250
Yo, here you go.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.330
His name is Ron, by the way.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.490
His name is Ron?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.830
Yeah.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.410
What are his qualifications as a Bible teacher?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.060
What qualifications are you looking for?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.680
Well, I'm just asking, do you have any qualifications?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.160
Because he called you a Bible teacher.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.700
I want to know if you teach at an actual university or you teach at a church.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.220
Well, I've read the Bible through 135 times or more.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.860
Okay.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.940
So no qualifications.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.240
No.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.660
Hold on.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.700
You cut me off.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.120
I have a Bachelor of Divinity and a Master's of Theology.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.820
I have a doctorate in Christian education and a PhD.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.940
Fantastic.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.420
So you do have qualifications.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.960
But that doesn't qualify me as a Bible teacher unless I can teach the Bible.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.900
No, it's just whether or not you have an education that would warrant your actual practice.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.140
And it sounds like you actually do have some education.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:27.120
So I would love to hear a rational justification for why the Christian God is real.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.320
Well, let me ask you this before I answer that, because you asked for the qualifications.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.880
Jesus Christ wasn't educated.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.900
Yeah, but according to your theory, he doesn't need to be educated.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:48.040
Although, in my position, the fact that Jesus Christ wasn't educated actually helps my position,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.720
because I can look at the Bible and see where if you believe Jesus actually spoke the words that he spoke,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.960
then it's clear he's not educated and he doesn't actually understand what's in the Old Testament.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.420
But I don't actually believe when Jesus speaks in the Gospels that those are his words.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.360
Those are just words that people put on his mouth.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.000
And that's fine.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.120
Were you raised a Christian?

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.360
I had 12 years of Catholic schooling.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.340
I was a Christian myself for 20 years.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.620
I went to Bible college and seminary.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.070
Now, when you say Christian, you're talking about a Catholic?

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.590
Nope, Christian.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.430
That's why I said Christian, not Catholic.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.330
Okay, so you didn't go to Catholic school?

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.210
Catholic seminary.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.010
Okay, all right.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.950
That's fine.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.390
So what would be the evidence for the Christian God being real?

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.210
Well, I'd have to find the groundwork, because I was listening to you talk to Tay,

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.590
and you were saying you couldn't believe any of that,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:52.850
because as far as miracles, you've never read or never found any doctor or physician

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.370
that could attest to that miracle.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:04.010
But what you felt in your Christian education is that Luke wrote the longest gospel in the Bible,

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.950
and he was a physician, and he attested to every one of the miracles,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.710
because he was an eyewitness to most of them.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.250
Well, that has nothing to do with the topic of miracles.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.770
That has to do with the topic of whether or not you believe Luke was a trustworthy eyewitness.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.710
Yeah, but you said he wasn't trustworthy.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:19.790
I didn't say that at all.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.450
Well, he didn't have a doctor or a physician.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.470
He was a doctor.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.490
Well, that's if you think Luke wrote Luke.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.350
Well, if you're going to make up your decision that not Luke wrote it,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.650
do you see how all of your decisions are based on assumptions?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.070
No.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:42.790
Even if Luke wrote Luke, he wasn't an eyewitness to Jesus' life.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.130
Yes, he was.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.930
No, he wasn't.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.890
Well, then you really haven't read your Bible.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.050
I have read the Bible.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.650
Luke wasn't one of the disciples.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.250
Luke was the...

00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:04.870
So, Luke was a traveling companion of Paul and his physician according to history,

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.810
but the Bible doesn't explicitly tell you that.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.730
So, I know that Luke is an actual person.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:20.010
So, I know that Luke is an actual person that's listed in the Bible.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.690
We have tangential evidence that he could have been the actual author of Luke,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.110
but that doesn't mean he was an eyewitness to Jesus' life.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.190
He doesn't even claim to be an eyewitness to Jesus' life.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.350
That's not true.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.910
Okay, then show me in the Gospel of Luke where he claims to...

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:38.330
Luke chapter 1.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.870
All right, Luke chapter 1.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.170
Luke 1, Luke wrote,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:47.010
For as much as many have taken in mind to set forth in order a declaration of those things

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.470
which are most surely believed among us, even as they delivered them unto us,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.090
which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word of God,

00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:01.750
it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.790
to write unto thee, in order, and then you started with the birth of Christ.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.750
Fantastic.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.950
So, we're going to read this slowly since you couldn't read it appropriately the first time.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:14.810
It says,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.670
Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative about the events that had been fulfilled among us,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.870
Just as they were handed on to us by those from the beginning were eyewitnesses.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.310
Did he say he was one of the eyewitnesses?

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.310
Or does he say that he's receiving testimony from people claiming to be eyewitnesses?

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.890
Well, it's difficult because you're not reading it appropriately.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.350
I am reading it appropriately.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.830
I'm reading in the New Revised Standard Version,

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.710
which is the standard version that you would get handed

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.010
if you went to an actual Bible college or seminary that's even accredited.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:54.750
So, now I'm starting to doubt.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.990
So, you didn't go to a real college.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.690
You went to like Pensacola, didn't you?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.450
What's the name of the Bible college and seminary that you attended?

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.670
Because I'm willing to bet money they weren't accredited.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.210
Oh, oh.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.970
Well, let's play that game, okay?

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.710
You asked first.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.650
I called it.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.090
I called it.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:14.510
What?

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.070
I went to Bethel University, and then I went to Ashland Seminary,

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.490
both accredited respectable institutions.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.210
Oh, I see.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.650
Okay.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.250
So, that makes you wiser than everybody else.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.050
Where'd you go to?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.860
Why is that important?

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.240
Why are you hiding it, Tay?

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.320
Why are you so afraid that you graduated from Bob Jones University?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.440
No, I didn't graduate from Bob Jones University.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.200
Pensacola?

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.380
No, I didn't graduate from Pensacola Christian College.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:45.820
I didn't.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.720
Sam Gipp University?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.520
No.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.000
I don't even know who that university is.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.560
It's not a real university.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.520
It's a guy who taught in a church basement who was a King James only-ist.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.660
Do you think there's a reason why no accredited universities actually tell you to read the King James Bible?

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.180
Is there a reason you get all upset because of somebody answering you?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.620
I'm waiting for the answer.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.920
We don't like liars.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.200
I want the answer.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.160
I'm waiting for it.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.200
Where'd you go to?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.120
I just read you the verse down there.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.480
I want to know where you went to school at.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.780
Tay, I'm about to read Luke with you, but I want to know where you went to school at first because I think you're lying to the class.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.400
No, you don't know.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:37.160
Did you attend an accredited university or did you attend a basement church?

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.500
No, I did not attend a basement church.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.340
I don't even-

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.880
In fact, I've never been to a church in a basement.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.560
Fantastic.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.160
So, I want to know where you got your credentials at.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.180
Well, I'm not going to tell you that because you're not going to be able to do it.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:53.960
Fantastic.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.500
Okay.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.280
So, we got a-

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.320
They just proved their point.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.840
Why are we two such liars?

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.740
We got a basement university.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.380
You're not going to take the Bible.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.800
We got a basement university, King James only-ist guy on the chat.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.980
Let's go ahead and read the book.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.040
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:16.820
So, does Luke in chapter one claim to be one of the eyewitnesses or does he claim to be collecting the accounts of other people who were eyewitnesses?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.640
No, he said from-

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.500
Those folks were from the beginning eyewitnesses and ministers.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:21.760
Yes.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.380
He said he had perfect understanding.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.100
Was he lying?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.560
He had perfect understanding of what he received.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.560
Okay.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.160
Well, that's more than you've received.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.460
Well, that's irrelevant.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:37.040
I'm not claiming to be receiving witnesses from anybody.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.500
So, to the point that you brought up, Luke-

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.300
A little ago you were talking about the testimony of other archaeologists that-

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.740
Tay, I don't know why you can't use the Holy Spirit to let me talk.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.940
I need you to have a little bit of Holy Spirit patience so we can have a conversation here.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.340
Well, hold it.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.880
You don't believe in the Holy Spirit.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.540
Isn't that right?

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.560
You do.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.600
So, I need you to invoke your Holy Spirit so that I can get a word out.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.540
So, the point was that you said Luke was an eyewitness.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.380
Luke clearly wasn't an eyewitness and he doesn't claim to be an eyewitness.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.380
He claims to be-

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.580
You didn't hear me say-

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:16.700
He claims to be collecting and compiling the testimony of others who would have been eyewitnesses.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.990
I didn't say he was an eyewitness.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.210
I just read you that he said he talked to some eyewitnesses.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.530
No, you started this-

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.250
He's a perfect understanding.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.750
Okay, for everybody in the chat who is here, did this fake professor tell us that Luke was

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.710
an eyewitness before we started reading Luke?

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.110
Yes.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.250
No.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:37.790
Let's hear it.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.850
You're on.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:43.250
Let's put a one in the chat if the fake professor with no credentials lied on this.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.630
No, you're recording it.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.950
Just go back and play the recording.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.570
It's a million percent going to be clipped.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.270
Okay, so who is the next eyewitness that demonstrates that your God is real?

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.810
Well, you didn't take the first one.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.650
He was a physician.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.770
You said you wouldn't believe it if it wasn't documented by a doctor.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.070
I said eyewitness and I didn't say documented by a doctor.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.570
What's your evidence that Luke even existed-

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:11.730
You did say doctor.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.970
Who's your evidence-

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.470
I'm sorry, what is your evidence that Luke was even the doctor who wrote the gospel of Luke?

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.110
Because the Bible calls him the beloved physician.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.410
Now, it's the Bible-

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.970
I know, but how do you know-

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.790
That was a lie.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:24.750
But how-

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:31.470
But how do you know that the doctor that is mentioned is the guy who wrote the book?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.650
Because nowhere in the book is there any attribution of authorship.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.850
Well, that's not true either.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.950
Okay, find it for me.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.810
Show me in the book where it says, I, Luke, wrote this, or this is the handwriting of Luke,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.010
or I am the Luke that's mentioned elsewhere.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:54.070
Well, he said right there, for as much as many, and he goes down there and talks about them being first witnesses,

00:17:54.290 --> 00:18:00.430
and then it said, it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.570
to write unto thee.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.950
Yes, and who's me?

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.410
And who is me?

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.050
Luke.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.050
How do you know?

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:07.530
That's what we're talking about.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.370
How do you know that me is Luke?

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.370
How do you know it's not?

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:12.610
Exactly.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.290
Thank you.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.010
So, the author is not claimed anywhere in the book.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.710
So, you can't tell me that you know Luke wrote it when there's no author identified,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.710
which is baffling to me-

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.010
I write unto you.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.450
Which is baffling to me, because I've read the ancient Roman and Greek writings from historians,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.150
and they almost nearly always identified themselves.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:40.570
It's wild to me that you've got these fanciful stories that are the foundational mythology for Christianity,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.230
but the author couldn't bother to identify himself.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.430
He just identified him, and you're not going to accept that.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:53.830
Okay, show me where the author identifies himself as Luke.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:19:00.110
Luke chapter 1, verse 3, I write unto thee in order, most excellent tell.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.190
Okay, is I a name?

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.790
Is I a name?

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.270
It's a pronoun.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.770
Well, I've heard you use it several times tonight.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.010
Is I a name?

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.530
Well, if it's in reference to you, it may not be.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.730
This is very simple.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.430
I want to know how you connect I and me to Luke.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.710
Where can I find Luke in this?

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.150
Sir, have you lost your mind?

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:32.030
It sounds to me like you're getting a little hot under the collar now that you've been pressed.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.910
No, I just got a question.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.090
Because people that don't go to your church don't believe your blatant lies or your fake education.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.390
No, you don't know that or not.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.950
You don't even know what church I'm with.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.310
I can know that you're with a garbage church that has a pastor with no credentials,

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.510
which is why you think the King James Bible is the correct Bible.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.490
No, that's not true.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.370
My wife is sitting here.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.350
She can testify to that.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.050
I'm sure.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:54.910
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.750
You're just making stuff up because you've got nothing sensible to say.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.670
I was a Christian long enough to know that people that believe the King James Bible

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:05.090
is the only true English translation are a joke.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.710
No, you don't know that.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.650
I do know that.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.170
No, you're just making up things.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.590
Is every other version a perversion?

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.150
You tell me.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.670
You're the one who's supposed to be the expert.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.870
I'm asking you your opinion.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.550
I'm asking you your opinion.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.190
Is every other version a perversion?

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.820
Every other version of what?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.600
Your story?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.340
Every other English version of the Bible.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.220
Is it a perversion?

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.860
No, I wouldn't call it a perversion.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.440
I love these kings.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
Why would you call it a perversion?

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.760
I love the King James only-est.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.320
I'm using one of your slogans.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.840
Maybe you're not familiar with this one.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.680
You just read from your version of the Bible.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.480
Is that a perversion?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.620
No, I don't think you understand the point that I'm raising.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:54.580
There's a popular saying among King James only-est, and the saying is every other version

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.700
than the King James version is a perversion.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.640
Have you never heard this one?

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.810
I'm asking you.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:01.770
I just asked you.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:08.090
I asked Tay, I need you to focus and listen to my words.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.610
I asked you a simple question.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.210
Have you ever heard of this saying?

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.450
It's a yes or no question.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.080
I need you to really focus.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:16.980
No, I haven't.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.100
Fantastic.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.480
So I'll explain it to you.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.400
Among King James only-est, they believe that every other English translation is an improper

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.180
translation.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.620
There's an old saying that popped up that says every other version is a perversion.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.880
Now, I assume that you knew that because it's such a popular saying.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.040
I shouldn't have assumed.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.920
That's my bad.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.520
But fact of the matter is, I've never met a King James only-est that had an appropriate

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.200
education.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.640
Because if you went to an accredited school where you learned proper Greek, Hebrew, and

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.980
Aramaic, you would understand that there are just better translations out there.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.100
So that being said, it's hard for me to take you seriously.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.480
That being said, I would love to hear, still yet, the evidence why your God is real.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.140
Because you're real.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.360
That's not a good argument.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.920
Me being real is not evidence that your God is real.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.640
I'm not trying to convince you.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:21.280
Imagine being on a live with your Bible student listening and getting utterly roasted by somebody

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.180
half your age.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.360
The fact that I exist is not evidence.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.020
That's your opinion.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.400
The fact that I exist.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.080
On the contrary, the folks sitting at this table don't think you're-

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.000
The fact that I exist is not evidence of your God.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.680
Tay, do you have anything better than that?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.700
I'm sorry.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.340
What's your real name?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:36.820
You're not Tay.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.560
No, I'm not Tay.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.520
What's your name?

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.060
You haven't given me your name.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.780
I asked you your name.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.460
You wouldn't give it to me.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.360
My name's Justin and you never asked.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.440
My name is Justin and you never asked.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.380
Okay, you're Justin.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.400
Okay, I'm Ron.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.360
Fantastic.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.420
Ron, welcome in.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.400
So what is the evidence that your God is real?

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.500
And just saying that I exist isn't evidence.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.380
The evidence for me.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.020
The evidence for me.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.860
And that's all I need.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.020
I don't need any evidence from you.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.200
The evidence for me that God is real is that you are real.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.260
That's not evidence.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.140
It is to me because you didn't come of your own will.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.540
You just didn't sprout in here because you had a mental thought one day and just appeared from nowhere.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.120
Things don't come into being by thought.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.720
They come into being through natural processes.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.340
So I'm here because my father-

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.240
Because God is-

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:33.640
I'm here because my father looked at my mom and said hubba hubba and did some things that are unmentionable.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.440
That's why I'm here.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.880
I'm not here because somebody spoke me into existence.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.380
So that's not an actual argument because that same argument could be used for any other metaphysical claim on the planet.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.260
I could use the same argument for Zeus.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.480
I could use it for Vishnu and Shiva.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.840
I could use it for the tooth fairy.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.080
So what's your evidence for your actual God?

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.560
Because you exist and you know it-

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.260
This is embarrassing.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.620
I don't-

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.740
I don't-

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.120
I don't-

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.360
Ron, I don't know it.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:10.840
I would love for you to give me the actual evidence rather than just saying that I know things that I don't know.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.920
You're not a mind reader.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.820
Neither are you, but you've been trying that all night.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.140
No, you're trying to tell me what's in my brain.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.500
And what's in my brain is not what you think it is.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.980
No, you asked me what I have in my brain.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.040
So Ron, what's in my brain?

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.220
So Ron, what's in my brain?

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.760
So Ron, yeah, because it's not good evidence.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.340
I want to know real evidence.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.200
It's not good for you.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.620
It's not good for anybody.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.840
Everyone put a one in the chat if you think-

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.240
Well, I don't know, but-

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.440
Everyone put a one in the chat if you think that the fact that things exist is evidence that God is real.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.840
I want to see it.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.780
Go outside and look out.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.340
Look at the trees.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.700
Look at the trees.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.540
How do you know that the trees aren't a product of Zeus?

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.720
How do you know they're not?

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.080
I'm asking you.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.180
How do you know that the trees-

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.380
I'm asking you too.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.560
I don't believe in-

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.960
You want me to answer, but you won't answer.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.520
I don't believe in Zeus, Ron.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.700
That's painfully obvious.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.560
I'm asking you, how do you know-

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.700
When you're asking God, you're just lying about-

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.080
Ron, I need you to have a little bit of patience and let me finish a question.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.440
You can't answer a question if you don't hear the question.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.340
How do you know that nature came from your God as opposed to Zeus?

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.900
Because he said it in his word.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.220
How do you know that his word is from him?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.140
God created the heaven and the earth.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.200
Yes, but I don't believe that the Bible is from God.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.680
Well, why would I believe that a book that doesn't get science right, doesn't get history

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.700
right, is from God?

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.120
Because you believe all this other nonsense.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.780
Why not?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.700
I believe in evidence and science and facts, which is why I don't believe in the Bible.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.580
What approximate-

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.580
You're not putting any of that on the lines.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.520
I'm about to.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.580
What approximate time period was the Exodus-

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.120
You've been going for an hour and haven't done it.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.340
What approximate time period was the Exodus according to the Bible?

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.920
What was the period of time for Genesis 1?

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.240
That's what I quoted.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.120
I didn't quote Exodus.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.200
I quoted Genesis 1.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.820
I could care less.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:20.040
My point is what would be the approximate time period of the Exodus according to the Bible?

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:20.500
Do you know?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.140
Do you know the time period of Genesis 1-1?

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.180
I'll just tell you.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.640
Yeah, according to the Bible, Genesis 1-1 happened roughly 4,000 BCE, but I'm asking you about

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.100
the Exodus.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:41.560
The Exodus according to 1 Kings chapter 6 was 480 years prior to the building of Solomon's

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.340
temple, which happened in 970, which means the Exodus is in the middle of the 1400s.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.400
Now, who was the-

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.980
I know, and it was 400 years after Jacob and all the patriarchs went down into Egypt.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:53.480
So-

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.000
Keep listening.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.960
What does that have anything to do with Genesis 1-1?

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:06.780
So, what was the pharaoh listed, and whose storehouses were built by the Israelites?

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.300
Hey, I got a better question than that.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.420
I'm going to need you to answer my question and stop running.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.920
Use your Holy Spirit and give me the answer.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.280
What was the pharaoh named, and whose storehouses were built by the Israelites?

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.470
Well, you do the same thing.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.730
You give me his son's name and tell me who built their house.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.930
I'll just give you the answer, since you can't answer it honestly, because you don't

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:31.890
Holy Spirit.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.610
So, the pharaoh that's mentioned in both Genesis and-

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.930
Well, how do you know that if you don't believe in God?

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.590
So, the pharaoh that is mentioned in both Exodus and Genesis is Ramses.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.950
It says that they built the storehouses of Ramses and Pithom.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:52.710
So, do you agree that according to the Bible, pharaoh Ramses must have existed prior to the

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.050
Exodus?

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.810
Oh, I got all that.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.490
That's elementary.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.890
Okay.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:57.470
Okay.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.050
Then you're about to learn a good lesson right now.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.970
So, if you actually knew-

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:06.370
Thank you for the $20, and thank you everyone who's been sending gifts and Venmos to help

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.270
me with this hurricane.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.850
Also, I'm home, and did you know they have no cases of water?

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.730
We have to be a limit of two to four gallons of water.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.410
It's ridiculous.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.530
But I'm home.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:18.650
That's good.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.450
We're glad you're safe.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.430
Guys, make sure you're showing Hanji some love.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.630
She's in the path of the hurricane.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.190
She's trying to stay safe here.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:33.350
Anyways, so, if the Exodus was in the middle of the 1400s BCE, then they certainly couldn't

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:39.130
have built the storehouses of Ramses, because Ramses' storehouses were built in the middle

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.250
of the 1200s.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.770
He reigned from 1279 to 1213.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.540
And your point is what?

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.720
My point is, the biblical chronology gets history wrong.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.620
They couldn't have built the storehouses of Ramses if Ramses didn't exist for another

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.440
200 years.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.140
No, history gets the biblical truth wrong.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.200
Oh, so what is the evidence that Ramses lived in the 1400s?

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.600
Because you're spending all your time-

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.420
Listen to this guy.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.560
Every Egyptologist you've ever heard, are you aware that even Christian Egyptologists

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.200
believe that Ramses lived in the 1200s?

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.980
I don't really care one way or the other.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.620
Have you read K.A. Kitchens?

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.540
Do you know anything from James Hoffmeyer?

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.380
Do you know a single Egyptologist?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.860
Have you ever read the Bible through from cover to cover?

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.220
Multiple times in the original language.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.860
Oh, really?

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:40.800
Yeah, because those of us who went to accredited schools had to actually learn Greek and Hebrew,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.100
which is why we don't read the King James Bible.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:44.640
Oh, okay.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.260
Well then, give me Genesis 1 in the Hebrew.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.540
Bitter sheep-

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.020
Right now, from an accredited viewpoint.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.500
I'll just quote it from my memory.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.280
Bitter sheep, barah, Elohim.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.360
In the beginning, God created.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.340
Ha-shamayim et ha-eretz, the heavens and the earth.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.980
Oh, they quit reading it.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.200
I'm looking right now at the screen.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.440
I just quoted it to you.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.180
I understand.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.960
I saw you looking at the screen.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.380
I could tell you weren't quoting anything.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.820
I'm looking at you right now.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.400
I know it.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.500
I understand what you're doing.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.840
This guy's crying.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.300
Give me Matthew 1 in Greek.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.240
I actually don't know Matthew 1 in Greek.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:23.620
Okay.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.880
I appreciate you being truthful on that point.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.540
Well, I'm not going to lie to you.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.460
Why would I lie to you?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.980
You're not the type of guest that needs to be lied to to get taken down.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.660
You've been lying your ass off all night.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.140
I'm not.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.420
You've been crying all night.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.460
No, you didn't hear no tears coming out of my eyes.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.240
I'm hearing them right now.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.560
And you have no answer.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.020
You have no answer.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:44.740
You're a man.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.800
You have no answer.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.100
You have no answer for Ramesses.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.060
I'm still waiting for an answer to Ramesses.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.020
Just tell me what historical evidence do you have that Ramesses lived in the 1400s?

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.500
Just tell me what historical evidence you have that you're not called to preach by a God and the Holy Spirit and you refuse to do it.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.380
You want to act like an idiot instead of a preacher.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.220
I'm an atheist.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.440
I'm not called by anyone.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.400
Your God is fiction.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.880
Hold on.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.520
The only one acting like an idiot, Ron, is you.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.320
Because one, you haven't answered a damn thing.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:24.320
Two, clearly, you Christians have a habit of lying not only on your own book but on your education.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.280
That's pathetic on your behalf.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.360
Three, how are you a grown-ass man twice Justin's age and you can't even act like a civilized adult?

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.840
That is pathetic.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.560
That is idiotic.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.460
And I'm honestly tired of hearing it.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:45.400
Now, if you don't answer this question, I will be the one to boot your ass off of this platform because I am the goddess here.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.540
Yeah, Hanji actually is in charge here but I am having fun talking to Ron, to be honest.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.780
This is a good time.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.360
I know.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.960
So, Ron, you've been here.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.280
I don't know.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.220
You've been here for, what, 20 minutes?

00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.780
11 minutes?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.200
Whatever.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.220
Let me see.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.720
You've been here for, oh, shit.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.860
I've had Tay on here for an hour and 15 minutes already?

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.780
That can't be right.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.340
Anyways, that's how long the live's been.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.640
I don't know how long you've been up here.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.720
Oh, 32 minutes.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.200
There we go.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.760
So, I've heard 32 minutes of nonsense.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.460
I haven't heard one rational argument for why your God is real.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:18.960
Not one.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.880
Do you have one?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.380
Can I unmute myself and speak?

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:32.320
So, the way questions work is when I ask you a question and then I stop talking, I'm expecting you to answer the question.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.140
Do you know that?

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:33.700
Yep.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.080
Yeah, but you had me muted.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.860
Yes, because you never shut up.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.380
So, can you answer my question?

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.160
What was your last question?

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:52.800
So, you've been here for 32 minutes and I haven't seen one rational piece of evidence or argumentation for why your God is real.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.020
I'm just looking for one.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.800
What's one rational argument?

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:04.840
Well, what I was doing as I came on to see if I could get one rational evidence from you that he's not real and I haven't heard that either.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.440
Well, you haven't asked for it.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.120
I'll give it to you.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.440
I'll give it to you.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.060
So, I'll give it to you since you asked for it.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:18.220
So, now that you've let me know you actually want a good argument for why your God isn't real, I know to give it to you.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:22.480
So, in order to do that, let me get a couple foundational claims about your God.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.700
Is it your belief that your God created all things?

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.180
I thought you was going to give me some foundational thing.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.160
I'm about to.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.580
Now you have some questions you want me to give them.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.840
I need you to define some of your beliefs about God before I tell you why he's not real.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.600
Do you believe that your God created all things?

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.820
Oh, I believe God is real and there is nothing, absolutely nothing that you can say.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.640
That's not an answer to my question.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.580
I'm asking you, do you believe that your God created all things?

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.960
Yes, God created all things.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:51.600
Fantastic.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.260
Did he create time?

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.030
He's outside of time.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.130
Did he create time?

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.960
If it exists, he created it.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.140
Okay, so according to your review, he did create time, yes or no?

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.700
God created everything, including you and time.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.860
I don't know why it's so hard for you to say yes or no.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.620
I'll ask you for the last time, did God create time, yes or no?

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.740
Yes, he had to.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.400
Thank you.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:18.900
Fantastic.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.920
That wasn't hard.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.460
I'm going to give you a couple logical premises and I want you to give me yes or no answers.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.140
Premise number one.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.020
I don't promise to give you a yes or no answer.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.180
Premise number one.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.700
This is how deductive arguments work, okay?

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.840
Premise number one, creation is a change of states, yes or no?

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.460
I told you, I wasn't going to give you a yes or no.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.380
A premise number.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.120
You're the one who created the foundation.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.320
Just go ahead and land it.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.280
Quit asking questions, just lay the foundation.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.280
No, the way logical premises work is you have to engage with each premise with me

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.180
because it might be that you disagree with one of the premises.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.980
So I'm sorry that you've never used a logical argument before, but that's what we're doing right now.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:05.760
So premise number one, do you agree or disagree that any act of creation is a change of states?

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.660
You're not laying any kind of foundation, Justin.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.160
This is how premises work.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.820
You're looking for answers.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.620
Ron, I'm not looking for an answer.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:22.360
I need you to either agree or disagree with the premise because we can't move to the next premise until you agree or disagree.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:29.940
So premise number one, do you agree or disagree that any act of creation is a change of states?

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.880
I don't know what that means.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.660
No, I don't.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.560
I'm not agreeing to anything you say right now because you're not saying anything that's fundamentally sound or foundational.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.380
This is not a foundational claim.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.620
This is how logical premises work.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.260
It's just, it's just, it's just, I'm not laying a foundation of anything.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.860
I'm giving you a logical, is it?

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.240
No, I didn't.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.020
This is a logical premise-based argument.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.360
There's multiple premises that leads to a conclusion, but I can't just give you the conclusion.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.260
You have to actually listen to the premises and either accept them or reject them.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.040
Right, I reject everything you say.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:09.700
Fantastic.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.280
So premise number one is that any act of creation is a change of states.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.620
Do you accept or reject?

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.520
What does mean change of states?

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.340
You're still not laying any kind of foundation.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.300
You're asking questions.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.580
Ron, if you don't give me a yes or a no, I'll just move on to an actual adult that will.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.720
So do you agree or disagree that any act of creation is a change of states?

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.700
What is a change of states?

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.020
You need to get saved, Justin.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.080
All right, so you're not a real adult and he ran.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:38.820
Fantastic.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.540
Nope, I kicked him.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.500
I got tired of his shit.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.940
I think everybody was.
