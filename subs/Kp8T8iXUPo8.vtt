WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Well, welcome in, Dr. Derek McAllister. For those who don't know Dr. Derek, Dr. Derek is

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.340
a professor of philosophy, and he's come to have a conversation with us heathens today.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.420
And, Derek, we appreciate you spending some time with us.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.980
So I will start with the typical question, which is, what would be the best evidence

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.740
or argument for your particular God being real?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.880
Yeah, sure. So can I ask a preliminary question just before we get into that? Because I know

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.620
once we get into that, it'll kind of get left behind. So could I ask why you want to know?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.400
Because I think believing things that are true is a good thing to do.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.300
Okay. So is it a matter of, just to get clear here, you're trying to find out if God exists,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.180
and if he exists, you're on board with it, you would believe? Or is it just maybe merely

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.720
educational? It's like, well, I just want to kind of lay out these answers out there for everybody

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.160
to see. It doesn't matter to me, either one. I just kind of want to know where we're starting from.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.060
Well, I want to believe whatever is true, right? Now, it just so happens to be, I don't see any

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.560
good reason to believe that God is real. But if there was a good reason to believe so, I certainly

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.860
would. Now, when it comes to, like, the formal versions of God, like the God described in the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.660
Quran or the Bible, different things like that, I don't think there's any redeeming those particular

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.460
God concepts. But if there's another God concept that can be proven, I'd certainly be open to it.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.900
Sure. Yeah. So to answer your question, I'm Catholic. I'm a Catholic convert, actually,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.280
it took me a while to get there. But I've only been Catholic for about six years now. Raised Christian,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.540
more or less my whole life, I had a period where I was an atheist. So I'm quite familiar with the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.780
thinking that goes into that. And I was convinced that God did this for a while. But so if you were

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.580
asking me my reasons, I think the best evidence for believing in God is the cosmological argument in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.240
the original initial event of the Big Bang. Okay, so Kalam.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.360
Well, not necessarily the Kalam version, but I prefer the five ways.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.880
Aquinas'?

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.440
I take them all as, yeah, Aquinas' five ways, which originally are actually Aristotle's.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.100
So I think it's significant that, you know, even a so-called pagan, you know, believed that there

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.000
was some divine creator beginning to the universe. Well, yeah. I mean, the pagans believed in a God

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.820
or multiple gods. I think the way we say pagan today has a different meaning than what people

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.260
might have meant a long time ago. But that being said, go ahead then, if that's the argument you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.540
want to start with, I guess start it any way you want to, whether you want to explain it or

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.020
the way you don't want to give premises. Yeah. Well, so I have done videos on this. You're

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.760
welcome to go look at my channel on it. Anybody is welcome there in my lives. I did a full one and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.480
two version of, I kind of split it into the five ways, one through three and the four through five.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.640
So you're welcome to go see them if you really want to do a deep dive. But basically the idea is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.560
it had to have come from somewhere, the initial event. And I think most, most scientists,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.980
scientists, and I'm not sure about most philosophers because they're kind of wonky

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.880
sometimes, but most scientists believe in the big bang. Um, at last I checked the statistics on that

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.240
are about 99.9% of scientists believe in the big bang. It's just like what, what might be before,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.080
whether there are multiverses, whether there's a big crunch coming after that or a big freeze.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.720
So in other words, they put qualifications on what, what you mean by the big bang, but most believe

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.500
in a big bang, sort of some initial event. Um, now based on what I've seen with you before,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.340
uh, you'd seem to think that the universe is eternal. Now, do, do you think that that,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.420
I don't know. So I don't believe that obviously I think that there had to be some initial event.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.900
Why? I wonder what makes you believe that. So I think because an infinite regress is impossible.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:27.720
Why? Because if an infinite, if an infinite, if an infinite regress exists, then it had to have had

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:38.800
a cause. No, it's an infinite chain of causes. So when it comes to the universe existence, right?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.180
It's either going to be, okay, the reason for the universe existing is just, there is no reason.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.720
Another answer would be, okay, it has a reason for its existence, but it's within itself.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.940
And then the third, of course, the Christian response would line up with this one.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.640
It has a reason for its existence, but that reason is external to the universe. So I go with

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.800
the third, but which one of those are you going with?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.120
Yeah. Well, I don't believe the universe has a reason, but I also don't think that

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.440
we have any reason to believe that it had an initial moment either.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.460
So you don't believe in the Big Bang?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.280
No, I do. I think you fundamentally misunderstand what the Big Bang is. The Big Bang is not saying

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.380
that the universe once didn't exist and then it poofed into existence. In fact, a recent study has

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.640
been done on this, a recent survey has been done on this and discovered that the majority of

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.920
cosmologists and physicists agree with that sentiment, that the Big Bang was not necessarily

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.760
the start of all things. It's just how we got to where we're at today.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.330
Okay. So what came before the Big Bang then?

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.090
I mean, you tell me. No one really knows. Like, we don't have the tools to investigate

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.850
what form or what shape the universe was in prior to the Big Bang, but there's a couple

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:05.070
different models for it. There's cosmic inflation, there's quantum foam, and then there's the Big

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.370
Bang, Big Crunch theory. My particular opinion is that the Big Bang, Big Crunch theory is the

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.370
most, not the most credible, but I think it makes the most sense.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.850
The Big Bang, Big Crunch?

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.710
Yeah.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.130
Okay. That's where we had a bang and it's likely to sort of reverse and go back and do a crunch

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.790
and perhaps do the same thing over and over?

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.570
Yeah. An infinite number of times.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:37.550
Okay. So I looked up that as well. And cosmologists, this is not necessarily a fringe

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.110
theory, but it's not a dominant theory. Not very many cosmologists.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.790
Well, there's no dominant theory.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.970
Well, the dominant theory would just be the Big Bang.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.210
Well, the Big Bang doesn't posit before the Big Bang. The Big Bang doesn't make a claim as to

00:06:53.210 --> 00:07:04.980
what came before it. Yeah. No. So in its current form, it is quiet about that. It has a sort of

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.120
agnostic view about what came before, if anything came before. And so these, like I was saying,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.880
these qualifications or these add-ons, but this certain qualification, the one with the Big Bang

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.220
and then the Big Crunch, just is not one that's widely held.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.380
Well, I would disagree. Where do you get that number from? Because I stream every Sunday with

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.480
an actual physicist, a PhD physicist who disagrees with that vehemently.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.820
Okay. I mean, I'd love to talk to him. I mean, I'm open to learning about this.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.360
But it's my understanding that that's not a very dominant model. First of all, because you would

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.460
need for it to slow down. It's not showing any signs of slowing down.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.760
It is.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.320
Expansion.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.840
Okay. And if it were...

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.320
The acceleration rate, according to the latest DESE data, is that the acceleration is decreasing

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.400
with every measurement.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.040
Because of that reversing. That's just sort of this hypothetical speculation that we

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.560
suppose will happen, but there's no evidence that it will.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.100
Gravity is the evidence.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.040
Why think that gravity will somehow make everything come back into one point?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.440
Because that's how gravity works.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.520
Gravity holds planets in orbit around their stars, around certain things with mass, but they don't.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:34.500
I mean, what would be the central point of the universe that would be the thing with, you

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.920
know, infinite, almost infinite, but a really infinitesimal...

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.680
Well, sorry, I used that word wrong.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:49.040
So a really large, let's say, mass enough to swallow the universe back up into itself.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.360
Well, it's not being swallowed into a mass. It's forming a mass when it collapses.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.460
Right.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:01.320
Right. Yeah. I just... I mean, because if you get far enough away from a planet, you're

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.360
no longer in its orbit.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.860
Yeah.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.700
So this point, let's say the initial point, not chronologically speaking, but in spatial

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:17.120
terms, if you get far enough outside that thing's orbit, then it just wouldn't have any

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.720
impact on it anymore, especially if it's accelerating and it's decelerating.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.420
So we're to suppose that somehow it's going to...

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:33.240
I mean, I can understand the reasoning because it's like throwing a ball into the air, but that's

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:41.260
when you have an enormous mass, the earth, with enormous force of gravity, and you're

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.960
throwing this really tiny ball up in the air. Of course, it's going to come back down.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.020
But why think that the universe is like that? What would be the central point that is so...

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.380
Because we have mathematical models that predict it. So Sean Carroll has already done the work

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.720
on this. He's published on it.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.080
Okay.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.700
Okay. Yeah. So I'm not familiar with that. Now, I don't buy this. There's a lot of reasons

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.100
to be skeptical about this, I think. But I think we can even go further, right? So like

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:18.060
if this model is true, this supposes an infinite regress. And I just don't think an infinite

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.920
regress is possible. I think in principle, it's not possible.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.420
Why not?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.740
I think it's mathematically possible, but I don't think it's physically possible.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.480
Well, why not?

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.720
Because we don't ever see that in reality. We've never seen it before.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.160
So Dr. McAllister, I'll let you know, I have the infinite regress argument at least once

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.980
a week. Everybody who doesn't like this theory is positive that infinite regresses aren't

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.700
possible. Not one of them can tell me why. So if the only argument is, well, infinite regresses

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.500
aren't possible because I don't like them, that's not a good argument.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.080
That's not the argument I'm making. I said that they're mathematically possible. Sure. I mean,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:07.660
we can just think of negative numbers. They regress infinitely. But for someone to claim that in

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:15.560
the physical world, there's an infinite regress going back in time of physical objects, this is a

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.560
hard claim to swallow. I don't think it's physically possible. And because there's no direct

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.980
empirical observation of it.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.260
Well, the observation in science is that matter and energy can't be created or destroyed.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.400
So that means it existed forever.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.960
That's not necessarily true.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.500
Give me one good reason why I would believe that all the matter, time and space in our

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.820
universe once just didn't exist.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.980
So, so let me go back to that claim. I agree with you that matter can neither be created nor

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:57.240
destroyed. Perfectly fine with me. I don't agree with the inference to the conclusion that

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.980
therefore the universe is eternal. I don't think, I think that's a bit of a leap.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.380
Well, can something come from nothing?

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.010
No.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.370
Okay. Well, we've got two logic arguments then. Premise number one, something doesn't come

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.330
from nothing. Premise number, or conclusion, or premise number two, we have something.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.470
Conclusion, there's always been something.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.610
Right. And the Christian would just say that that's God.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.990
And the non-Christian would say there's no need for a God because the universe has existed

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.370
forever.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.890
Right. So I, so let me, let me explain the reasoning here, like I'm trying to get at.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:39.390
Right. So, like I said, I don't agree with the inference. I agree that matter can be neither

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.530
created nor destroyed, but I don't agree with the inference to the conclusion. Therefore the

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.810
universe is eternal. I don't agree with that because the Christian can also say consistently

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:55.030
that, yeah, matter can neither be created nor destroyed once matter has been introduced

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.890
into the world. Like, yeah, because why would we even have that principle to begin with? Because

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.690
through direct observation, we have this principle in science by people during the alignment

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.290
area, during the 1600s, 1700s saying, well, you know, matter can neither be created nor

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.990
destroyed. They're not saying that from the standpoint of the beginning of the universe.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:22.270
They're saying it as a principle of science based on observation. And then there, and so

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:28.430
to take that, take that really narrow claim and then apply it to, well, I suppose then

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:33.970
like, it would be understandable that within their perspective, that of course, at that time

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:40.010
in history, making that claim is not an extraordinary outlandish claim because it's understandable

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:46.770
that something would neither be created nor destroyed now, but that doesn't entail that it

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.290
was never created to begin with. Does that make any sense, what I'm saying?

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.430
It makes sense, but we have no evidence that it was created or that it once didn't exist, right?

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.950
Before we posit a need for a creator, we probably need to lay down some sort of established fact

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.270
that it once didn't exist and needed to come into an existence.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:13.630
Yeah. So I think a few of the arguments, Thomas Aquinas, like the contingency argument,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.210
for example, the idea that not everything in the world can be contingent.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:17.650
Why not?

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.390
And so if you want to say that the universe is eternal, I think you would have to say that

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:28.310
it would be necessary. Do you think that that's, do you think the universe necessarily exists? Like

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.970
it couldn't possibly be otherwise?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.530
I mean, the fact that it exists, I think demands that it does exist necessarily or else it wouldn't

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:35.950
exist.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:43.070
So it seems like a kind of bite the bullet, um, position you'd have to take. And that's

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.370
understandable. Um, is that the universe exists? I'm willing to bite that bullet. Yeah.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.790
That's not what I meant that the universe exists necessarily because it exists.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.610
So that the universe exists necessarily, it's sort of a bite the bullet. And that's understandable

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:03.030
because like, what other response could you have other than saying, uh, because, because if you want

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:08.610
to say it's contingent, which, you know, I think most things in the universe are contingent, right?

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.670
But like, I would say nearly everything in the universe is contingent, but professor, not

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.030
everything.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.030
Look at it from my point of view, right? We're saying that the thing that we know exists, the

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:22.350
universe, right? I'm saying the thing that we know for a fact exists, exists necessarily.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.950
You're saying, no, it once didn't exist and something that we have no evidence of caused it

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:33.730
to exist. So you're saying, I'm saying the thing we know exists, exists necessarily. You're saying a

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.250
thing that we don't know exists, exists necessarily and caused everything to come into existence.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.450
I think one of those is just an easier thing to grab hold of than the other. And the thing that's

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.290
easier to grab a hold of is the thing that we know already exists.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:53.630
That's fair. But think about this claim that the universe exists necessarily. Like I don't make

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.790
this claim about like oak trees, for example, obviously, because oak trees are contingent.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.970
It could have been otherwise. Like if an acorn falls down a hill, lands in a different spot,

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.570
gets eaten up by a squirrel or something, there's not going to be an oak tree there. So it could

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.250
very well have been otherwise. And you and I are both contingent. In fact, everything in the world

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:17.510
that we know of is contingent. So why think that universe is somehow different?

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.790
Why is it not contingent?

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:20.970
Right.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.870
No, no, I'm asking you. In my worldview, it's an infinite regress of contingencies.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.970
Do you see the absurdity that, with all due respect, like the infinite regress of contingencies?

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.370
Again, you haven't provided a reason why I should reject an infinite regress other than

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.310
incredulity. That if all you have against this is incredulity, you don't have an argument.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.430
It's not incredulity. I'm expressing incredulity, but it's not merely

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.870
incredulity. That's my reason. Let me try to unpack it.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.290
Then why can there not be an infinite regress in the past the same way there's going to be

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.850
infinite stuff in the future?

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:07.380
So if there were an infinite regress of contingent, let's say, chain of a series of events,

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.460
right? Because that's all the universe is. It's just objects. And then, you know,

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.880
there are changes, right? That accounts for both space and time.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.580
I think we agree there. Yeah. Is right. Space is just a measurement between objects

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:26.020
and time is just a measurement between change. So, so really we're not talking about space and

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.220
time. Forget about that. Those are just kind of like the buckets in which we place these things.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.480
Really, we're talking about objects and their changes.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:39.480
Well, I think you, for that conversation to be had, you might refer to physics and physics

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:46.700
believes that time and space are a web that is somehow a fundamental property of the physical

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:53.620
reality, right? So I don't know if I would call space time a bucket because it seems to be a property

00:17:53.620 --> 00:18:00.820
of the physical world. But I'm not a physicist. Someone like Sean Carroll, Dr. Blitz, William Kinney,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.140
like they could explain that in great detail that someone of, of my position couldn't.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.460
Sure. And I'm speaking outside of my expertise just to flag this. I'm not,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:19.140
I don't specialize in this area. Um, so I would be the first to defer to somebody who is an expert on

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.400
these things. But so far as I understand it, um, space time, however, they're interwoven,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.940
uh, it takes into, though that thing is not something that actually exists itself. That's

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:37.580
why I use the metaphor of a bucket. Uh, we can discard that if you like, but, but the idea here

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.100
is that space doesn't, it's almost like a hole. Can I ask a clarifying question? Are you suggesting

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:48.340
space time doesn't exist? I guess I'm confused. In the sense that a hole does not exist, right? If I dig

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.640
a hole, the hole doesn't exist because there's nothing like physical. There's no matter there or

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.600
anything like that's all I'm saying about space. Like it's just the space, the emptiness between

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:05.480
objects. I mean, perhaps I, I don't know if that's my understanding of space time, but I don't know

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.020
if it matters for, for where we, where we're trying to get to. And I don't know if we want to waste a

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:16.040
bunch of time on that, especially since neither one of us are actually physicists. Sure. So the idea

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.620
here is that instead of talking about space, time, and the beginning of the universe, because really

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.940
the universe is just the collection of the whole, I want to just talk about objects, the things

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:31.140
inside the universe, because that's really our, our, yeah, that's our focus. We want to talk about

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.820
the changes between those things. And, and once you talk about, you move the focus to those things,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.880
talk about those things are the things that form the series, the series of causes,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:47.140
the cause and effect, right? Um, I don't think that a series of contingent things

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:56.520
can have a cause and cause of it. Sorry. Cause and effect chain forever. Right. Why not? Because

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.840
if we are seeing, so let's take the line of dominoes, this very basic example, obviously the universe is

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.320
much more complex than that. And the objects in the universe are more complex, but if we take a line

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.120
of dominoes, the domino line is falling now, which, you know, in our analogy, it is falling. Now it's

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.500
moving. Now we see objects that are moving causes and effects are happening. So the line of dominoes

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:25.580
and the analogy they're falling. What we're saying, if it extends infinitely into the past is there is

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.700
no beginning. And so if there is no beginning, then the dominoes that are falling now shouldn't be

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.320
falling because they never began to fell. They never began to fall. We don't have dominoes.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.700
I understand the metaphor. The metaphor is like, we shouldn't have movement if there wasn't a first

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:49.540
move, but I disagree. I think it's a category or you're, you're suggesting that there needs to be

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:59.500
a first movement for movement to happen. I'm inferring based on, you know, there is movement now

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:09.440
and there had to be, have movement begin to move. So there had to have figure out, you know,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.680
let it be at whatever time you'd like. It could have been two hours ago, you know, could some

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.160
metaphysicians play around with this? They're like, Oh yeah, the universe could have just popped

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.080
into existence a second ago or something. I mean, theoretically that is possible. Like all of,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:29.260
all of our memories could just be fictitious made up at the moment of creation two minutes ago.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.220
Sure. Yeah. So people like to play around with this. So, so I'm not suggesting that of course,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:44.100
um, but it can be at whatever far back or however proximate to now recent, or it can be it, you know,

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:51.840
really far back in the past, but at some point there had to be some first domino to fall.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.960
Otherwise there just wouldn't be dominoes falling now.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.640
Well, I don't think so. I think that domino was caused by the domino prior to it and the domino

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.520
prior to it and the domino prior to it. And I think the, the God doesn't solve the problem

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.820
because the God has to figure out, uh, why that infinite regress is allowed through special

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:16.100
pleading, but the infinite regress of the universe isn't. So God, if you want to go there,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.500
if you want to talk about that, God's not an infinite regress. Oh, he certainly is.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.760
No, he's not. Why do you think that? Absolutely is. Because God can't exist without time either.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.640
Why do you think that God can't exist without time? Because you need time to do things and God

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:42.600
does things. Like God has thoughts, God speaks, all those things happen in time. God has thoughts,

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:50.560
God speaks. The only, according to Christian view that we're examining here, the first time that we

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.020
God's speaking is at the creation of the universe. He's spoken into existence. Right. So Christians

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:03.580
could, could say, okay, well, yeah, of course you get speaking there, but why think that they're

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.720
speaking prior to time? Like you suggested. Did he think about creating the universe before he created

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:15.580
it? Great question. God's thoughts, as we're told are not like our thoughts, but we can, you know,

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:23.640
not to be simplistic and patronizing about that, but God's thoughts are immediately accessible to him

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.680
at all times. And Christians believe in impassibility, that an unchangeability in God.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.520
Well, let me ask you a better question. You believe in eternity?

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.680
So that God would not be affected whatsoever. Yes.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.860
Do you believe that prior to the creation of the universe, that Jesus and Yahweh could have a

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:46.340
conversation with each other? I don't think that they would need to converse with one another.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.240
And the way that we are discussing. Yeah, of course.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.880
That implies time.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.640
That implies time if they did it. I only said it was possible that they did it.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.480
That's what I'm saying though. If they're capable of having a conversation, that conversation

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.680
could only happen in time. I mean, we're capable of going to Mars, but we haven't done it.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.540
Right.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.420
So like, but one of them is possible. Does it mean that it requires time?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:20.460
Right. So, so it, it would be like mental communication. It would be like my thoughts

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:25.340
being immediately accessible to me. Well, then they're not having more than they're not having

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.680
a more immediate way. Then they're not having a conversation.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.680
So no. So that it wouldn't be a conversation the way humans understand conversations. No,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.200
not at all. Okay. So then they technically can't have a conversation prior to the creation

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:47.430
of space, time, universe. So let me explain it to you this way. So, so just to answer your

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.250
question, sorry. Could you repeat the question? I don't want to just move on without.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:57.490
Right. Okay. So my, my complaint here is easy. Anything that involves a sequencing of time,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.410
like having a thought or sharing a thought, none of that's actually possible without time.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:11.140
Okay. Yeah. So, so the idea here is that God, according to philosophers and theologians,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.040
and I don't mean to bog this down in any terminology whatsoever, but it is clear that if we are

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.920
criticizing a specific view, it's important that we know what the view is claiming. I think you'd

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:28.540
agree. So, so philosophers and theologians think that God is what they call pure actuality. There is

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:34.840
no, so actuality and potentiality. These are pitted against each other as sort of like you have what's

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.780
potential, then you have what's actual, something that's potential, something that is possible to

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:44.480
happen. Something that is actual is just something that is currently happening. So if God is pure

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:51.200
actuality, that means that there is no potentiality in God. There's no potentiality at all. There,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.160
everything that could be happening to God is already happening. So this is how they consider God's

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.380
thoughts and ideas. They are immediately accessible. That's why I meant by immediately

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:08.020
accessible. The idea that these things are actually what they, anything they would be like for me as a

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:15.660
human and for you, we have potential thoughts. Not all of our thoughts are actual to us, but for God,

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.000
they are all actual to him.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.160
Right. Which is what I'm saying though, thoughts are sequenced.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.440
No.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.500
Or else you don't have a thought.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:32.300
Thoughts are only, thoughts are only sequenced if it's discursive reasoning. You know how it's,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.360
discursive means kind of like you write in cursive. It's like from one thought to another,

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.840
to another, to another, to another. This wouldn't be the case in God, in the mind of God.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.600
Oh, certainly it is. He says so in Exodus.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.400
How's that?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:27:12.230
Let me read for you. I think it's Exodus 33. Let me double check. Yeah. Exodus 33, 5. And I'll read

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.470
it to you. I'll put it on the screen, although you won't be able to see it, unfortunately, but I

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.850
think everyone else will be able to see it.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:18.450
I'm looking it up.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:39.060
Um, okay. So God is upset after the golden calf incident and he doesn't quite know what he's going

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:47.060
to do with the people. And so he says this really interesting thing. Um, has Moses speak to the

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:53.320
people? And this is his words. Uh, the Lord said to Moses, say to the Israelites, you are a stiff

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.860
necked people for, I'm sorry, if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.980
you. So now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you. And some translations

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:10.200
will say, I will think, or I will consider what to do with you, which means God's processes,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.320
his mental faculties are operating in a sequence.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.360
Okay. So that, that's your proof that God thinks discursively.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.240
Well, he says so.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:30.300
Right. Okay. So, um, first of all, it's very dangerous to have one cherry picked text as

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:35.640
a proof text. Um, and we know that in Christian theology, I've got more, uh, anthropophobic,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:42.140
anthropomorphic traits are projected onto God that God doesn't necessarily have. Like,

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.800
does God really walk in the garden? Uh, does God really have a face that he turns to people

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:55.600
and turns away from people? No, of course not. So, um, he puts things in terms that humans

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.060
can understand it, you know? So I think that I would translate this. I think I'm not alone.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:07.340
Let me think about what to do with you. It would be something like, look, what I end up doing is

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:14.300
going to be dependent upon what you do. Like, it'll, like what avenue you choose is going to

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.560
determine what my, my, uh, my outcome is.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.960
And the problem is he didn't say that. That's what you want him to say.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:30.060
Right. But the problem is the Bible doesn't read like wooden literalism.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.780
Right. But the problem is I'm reading it for what it says. And God says, I need to make a decision

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.980
about what to do with you people. That is a sequenced event.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.560
I didn't expect to get into, uh, biblical analysis here, but let me ask a follow-up question with

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:55.600
respect to just interpreting. Would you suggest then that anytime the Bible says something,

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.760
we should just take it at face value? No, I think we know when an idiom is being employed. Like when

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.880
it says Adam knew his wife Eve, we know that's an idiom for doing the cha-cha. We get that. And

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.440
there's lots of Hebrew idioms. I, I know because I had to learn them when I took Hebrew. So the reality

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.860
is we know when a metaphor is being employed. We know when an idiom is being employed. This idea of,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:25.040
well, every time God says something that makes him look human-like, we just must assume that he

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.620
doesn't actually mean it. This is somehow him just anthropomorphizing himself, which is not actually

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.980
the case because in the narrative that we just read, not only is he talking about doing a sequence

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.820
of events, he does a sequence of events and he does so elsewhere. There's a bunch of instances

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:46.560
where God is finding things out or knowing things in a sequenced event.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.360
How do you mean?

00:30:51.200 --> 00:31:01.340
Like when he has Abraham almost execute his son, all right? Talk about Genesis 22, right? In verse 12,

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.600
in Genesis 22, when he's got the dagger in the air, he's about to stab, and he gets stopped. He says,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.500
now I know, right? He's saying, now I have the information. He says the same thing in Deuteronomy

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.960
chapter 13. He's going to test his people to know what is in their heart. He says the same thing in

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.900
Deuteronomy 18 before he declares that he's going to execute everybody in Sodom and Gomorrah. He says,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:32.800
I must go down and see if the outcry that has risen up to me is as what it seems, and then I will know.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:40.480
Like God keeps employing this idea that he has information he needs to obtain, and those are

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.000
things that happens in sequences.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:50.240
Yeah, so this, I don't see this as information God needs to obtain. I see this as his interaction

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.880
with humans. I mean, that seems to be pretty obvious to me. I don't know how it can be confused.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.080
Does he know?

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.720
Yeah, of course.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.940
Then why does he say, then I will know?

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.240
Because he's writing for humans.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.680
But he could have just said, I already knew.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.020
See, this is the thing with communication. I'm sure you can understand this as well.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.520
If you wanted to communicate a very complex idea to somebody who didn't know it, would you, I mean,

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.900
you would bore people to that. I'm sure. I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't have many people be hanging

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:29.220
on it. So if in the Pentateuch, in these verses that you're offering here is evidence of, well,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.220
God must think discursively, and he changes his mind about things.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:32.680
He does.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.420
He's very human-like.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.600
Exodus 32, he does.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:42.900
Well, if that's the case, we can easily say that that's wrong, because God has these other

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:42.940
attributes.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.360
So the Bible is wrong?

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:49.340
Namely, no, I'm saying that's wrong. I'm saying that interpretation is wrong. Namely,

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.480
because we already know that God is the creator of the universe, and that God is absolute being

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.960
within the Christian world, which is what the world you're attacking is, correct?

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:05.240
So this is my favorite thing about talking to philosophers, is the God that you've dreamed

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.080
up through some philosophy is not the God of the Bible. The God of the Bible doesn't know

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.220
everything. The God of the Bible does change his mind. Do you want to see exactly where?

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.920
Go for it.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.880
Okay. We're going to go to Exodus 32. He clearly states, it clearly states that he changed his

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.060
mind. This is after the golden calf incident, right? Give me one second to grab the passage.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.820
Although, I think in the King James it says repented, but it's the same word in Hebrew.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:41.440
Okay, so if you go to Exodus 32, verse 12.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.720
32, 14.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:44.940
Right?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.000
And 14.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.780
Yeah, 12 through 14 is kind of the same situation. He says he's going to wipe out all these Israelites

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:57.520
because they've acted wickedly, and then it says the Lord changed his mind about the disaster

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.700
that he planned to bring on his people. So he does change his mind.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.270
Right. So I don't see a problem here.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.790
Well, can an all-knowing being change his mind?

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:17.330
Let me ask you this, because the initial question in our conversation that you begin with is what's

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:23.210
your most compelling evidence for God's existence or for your God or what have you? I don't take

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:29.110
this problematic interpretation as evidence that God does not exist.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.910
No, no, no. I'm not saying that this proves—

00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:32.310
I think there's no inference there whatsoever.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.630
I'm not saying this proves no God exists.

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:39.870
I'm saying this proves that the God you think of is not the God of the book. The God of the book

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.590
changes his mind. He says he changes his mind.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:47.950
I don't think it does. I don't think it does. There's ways to synthesize what's being said here

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:50.330
with what theologians have said about God.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.150
I know what he says.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.970
And I think you know this.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.290
I think you know this.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:53.670
Read it out loud.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.430
I think you know this.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:01.750
I do know this, which is why I know that you're wrong. Verse 14 says Yahweh changed his mind

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.550
about the disaster. Did he change his mind or did he not?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.680
So that's anthropomorphic language. I mean, why say that right here—

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.640
You can't answer the question.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.020
Why say that—I am answering the question. Why say that right here, that means literal.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.440
He changed his mind. But when he walked in the garden, that's not literal.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:26.260
Well, again, I think he did walk in the garden. He does the same thing in Deuteronomy—

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.100
And he's got a face.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.080
He does the same thing in Deuteronomy 32. So there's actually good scholarship on this.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.520
I would recommend reading When Gods Were Men by Professor Esther Hamori.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:45.920
Mm-hmm. So this makes God into just sort of an anthropomorphic kind of member of a polytheistic

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.400
pantheon or something, something like the Greek gods or something, like very human life.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.320
The ancient convention of God in the ancient Near East and even in the Mediterranean were

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.640
that they were somewhat like superheroes. They ate and they drank. In fact, in Exodus, the

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:07.260
same book we were just reading. In chapter 24, God's on a mountain, and they see his feet. They

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:14.300
behold a vision of God, and they're up there having a meal with him. And then in Genesis,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.940
he eats. In Genesis 18.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:22.220
Okay, let me point you to—and I'm not trying to be a jerk about this, but if we want to get the

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.920
God of the Bible, we have to take the whole Bible into account.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:30.180
So Genesis 1, when God created everything, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.960
was without form, without shape, darkness, over the void, over the abyss, a mighty wind

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.460
sweeping over the waters. And God said, let there be light. That doesn't sound human to me. So if

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:46.480
these authors are saying, well, you know, God was just a human made into a God, that seems to ignore

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.640
the entire Genesis 1 account. Why do that?

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.760
Well, first of all, it doesn't. Second of all, that's not what I said. And to say Jesus or God

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:58.160
was a human, although Jesus was a human. I'm saying the God of the ancient Near East or the

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.980
gods in the ancient Near East were more human-like than the gods of philosophy. They could eat. They

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:09.300
could drink. They had anatomical appendages. They could speak.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.680
I agree.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.940
Like, they could hear. They had the physical capabilities of doing such things. When God

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:22.080
gets mad, in Hebrew, it literally talks about his nose, his off, his hot nose. Because the idiom

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.740
for being mad is that you got a hot nose, right? So all the language we have about God in the Bible

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.720
is that he's got these physical characteristics, which is why, interestingly enough, when he creates

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:40.080
mankind, mankind is created in the image, the likeness of God. And this is the exact same

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:46.000
verbiage that's used for all of Adam's descendants. Adam had sons in his likeness,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:51.120
meaning they have a physical representation that is like their maker.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:02.260
I'm just waiting for the conclusion, the inference to the conclusion that God does not exist, like

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.700
absolute being all reality, the creator of the universe.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.560
That's not my argument at all. My argument is that God you believe in is not the God of the Bible.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.580
The God of philosophy and the God of Christianity are two different things.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.740
I never said that I agree with the God of philosophy, the classic philosophers,

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.620
the God of classical theism. I never said that.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.220
Right.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:29.720
In fact, if you remember, I said I believe in the God is understood by Catholic theology. I'm Catholic.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.860
I said that at the very beginning.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.720
And again, my argument is about the Christian God, right, or Catholic God for your sake.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.800
And what I'm suggesting is that the way the Catholic God is described in the Bible

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.060
is not the same God you're describing through philosophy. They're different things.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.940
I would beg to differ because there's entire, if we're looking at the Catholic God and Catholic

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:58.060
theology, there's an entire tradition, which, as I was mentioning and gesturing out earlier,

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:06.700
that unpacks what these verses mean, right? This is why we have even textual analysis that we can say,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:12.800
oh, that means idiom. Oh, this is apocalyptic literature or whatnot. So that all came out of

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.560
this textual analysis and hermeneutics and interpretation.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.240
I've read the church fathers. They can't agree on what half these texts mean either. They can't even

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.180
agree on whether or not hell is eternal or whether or not it's just annihilation. They're split right

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.620
down the middle.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.360
Right. They have disagreements.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:31.880
Yeah.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:40.100
I don't see why that, I don't see how that undermines what my, my claim was, which was

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:45.220
my point is the foundation to interpret these, these things like that doesn't undermine that.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.760
You say they like they're a cohesive bunch. Like they came together and they agreed on an

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.380
appropriate interpretation of say, Exodus 32, 14. They didn't, they did no such thing.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.940
I'm not suggesting they all agreed. I suggest that you like the ones that agree with you.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:06.320
Theologians. I said, I'm suggesting that the theologians is a very conservative claim

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.440
here that I'm suggesting theologians, early church fathers, which you used as a collective

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.320
term. So I think I'm entitled to use as a collective church fathers. They disagree with

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.460
one another. Sure. They laid the foundation for interpreting the Bible. That's all I'm saying.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.740
Very conservative claim. I never, never said that they all agreed with each other, but they didn't

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:28.360
lay the foundation. If they can't agree on what it means, what they've done is giving, they give us

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.640
differing opinions, just like the Jewish rabbis in Talmud, the Jewish rabbis in Talmud argue with each

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.800
other all the time. They didn't lay the foundation for what the correct interpretation of all the

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.820
passages are. They laid a foundation of here are possible ways to interpret the passage.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:48.180
That's what I was getting at. I never said that they laid the foundation for the correct

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:53.560
interpretation. I mean, I think that's true, but my claim was that they laid the foundation

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.800
for interpreting these scriptures. That's all I said. It's a very conservative claim. I don't know

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.760
why you're disagreeing with it. No. Well, I don't think, uh, I think you and I were making two

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.280
different, uh, claims. Your claim sounded like the interpretation given by the church fathers should

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:13.400
be accepted because it's true. And I'm saying I don't have a good reason to accept it as true.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.980
That's a further claim, and I think that you were anticipating that, and I endorse that. So,

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.080
yeah, I think that there are certain interpretations that are correct.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:28.470
And I don't. So, I mean, I'm sure they get some stuff right and some stuff wrong, like every human,

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:34.450
right? When it comes to Acts 32 and the other passages where God clearly changes his mind, I have

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:39.990
no reason to believe that it means anything other than God changed his mind because I've studied the

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:48.170
ancient Near East and the gods changed their mind all the time. Okay. Yeah. So, this is where I am

00:41:48.170 --> 00:42:00.450
saying that we do not read the text literally in certain points. I know. Right? So, we are given

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:07.170
that guidance by theologians who came before us. Oh. And so... Okay. So, when Moses went down from

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:11.110
the mountain... I would not read that literally. When Moses went down from the mountain in verse 15,

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.350
he literally went down from the mountain, or did he metaphorically go down from a mountain?

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:21.150
He literally came down to the... See, that would be a really easy... What's your point?

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.690
Verse 13, the verse before it went, it says,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:29.030
Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your own self, saying

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:33.430
that I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the heaven, and all this land I have

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:38.430
promised, I will give your descendants, and they will inherit it forever. That's not metaphor.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:45.050
That's literal, right? Yeah. Okay. It's just that one verse where it says that the Lord changed

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:54.310
his mind. Now, we have to take that as non-literal. Sure. Why? Yeah, because of other things we know

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:59.870
about God's nature. Like what? That he's not human. I never said he was human.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.770
Are you sure you didn't say that? Could you remind me of what the claim was? Because you were

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:09.750
suggesting something about ancient Near East gods. The claim is that... And that the God of the Bible

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:14.010
is very human-like and unlike the God of the philosophers. So just remind me... The God of the

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:23.610
Bible is not an immaterial, spaceless, timeless deity. So, how do you arrive at that if, like I said in

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:30.070
Genesis 1, God created all of space and time and, you know, and matter. So, like...

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:35.410
He didn't. It didn't say that. He was... It did say...

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.390
Certainly did not say that. He created the heavens... God created the heavens and the earth.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.910
The sky and the land. Yeah. Hashemayim in Hebrew just refers to the skies.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:52.290
Okay. There's no concept of this celestial heaven far away from the earth in ancient Near Eastern

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:59.450
cosmology or even in the Bible. The sky is always the literal place where the clouds are, just above

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:04.070
the earth where God resides. In fact, his throne, according to Psalm 150, is just at the top of the

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:11.830
firmament. What do you think the God of the Bible is, then? Like, in terms of if he's not immaterial,

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.530
but that he created the heavens and the earth, is he some sort of demigod?

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:21.410
Well, again, you're assuming that there was nothing outside of the heavens and the earth.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.870
I'm not assuming anything. I'm asking a question.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:29.570
So, I would classify him as more in line with an ancient Near Eastern deity or even a Greek deity.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:34.810
Now, I believe that it's better to think of him like an ancient Near Eastern deity that has

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:40.310
both a spiritual and a physical presence. The spiritual presence can do some things that the

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:45.550
physical presence can. So, for example, if you read in the Hittite literature, there is an incantation

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:51.450
for performing the duties when you put up a new temple for the goddess of the night. And the goddess

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:58.770
of the night has an actual physical manifestation in the literature, but she can actually dwell in two

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:03.710
different temples at once because her spirit can dwell in one place and in another place at the

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:09.170
same time, even though she has a physical manifestation. The same way probably early people

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:15.710
thought about Jesus and the Father. He could manifest in multiple physical realities and multiple

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:21.570
spiritual realities because he's like a superhuman, more super than less human.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:33.560
Okay. So, okay. So, I don't have anything to reply to that, but it's just good to know.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:40.120
Right. But my interpretation, I can match up with everything the Bible says about God, right? The

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:46.760
idea that God is a spaceless, timeless, immaterial entity is not found in the Bible, right? You have

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.300
to intuit that from philosophy and then eisegesis that into the Bible.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.380
It's not eisegesis. It's exegesis. And it's good exegesis.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.040
Then show me the passage where it says that.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:03.850
I mean, I can show you some experts who know this a lot better than I do, and you—

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.230
But I studied with the experts.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:08.570
But I'm not an expert in this area. Look, man, I—

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:13.170
I can appeal to the experts. I can tell you my Old Testament professors who agree with me.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.790
I studied with experts as well.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:15.350
I know you did.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:21.110
I've got a seminary degree as well, but I don't wave it around. You've mentioned

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:33.830
half a dozen times that you've studied with or you've read this or you've read that. I'm not

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:39.550
an expert in this area. But if you want to talk about this, I'm not an expert in this

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:45.410
area. And so I'd like to get back, if you would like, with your permission, to the initial

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:52.270
conversation that I'm still not a specialist in, but I have a lot more understanding and

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:59.370
expertise in the area of philosophy of religion. I don't have—I said this in the email as well,

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:05.130
I said before. I said, look, I'm not an ancient Near East. I said this literally. I'm not an

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:10.730
ancient Near East expert. So I know that the conversation, of course, naturally goes here,

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.290
and that's your background a little bit. So you would naturally go there. But just to flag that

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:19.230
for anybody watching this, I'm not an expert in this area, and I'm not here to talk about

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:23.990
ancient Near East stuff. If you want to do that, talk to somebody else. Maybe Wes Huff. I saw somebody

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:28.350
in the chat asking you to get Wes Huff on. I think that'd be delightful to see that. I would tune in

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.750
for that. But I'm not the person to talk about ancient Near East stuff.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:41.360
Fair enough. But you are comfortable talking about the Bible, right?

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:49.740
Yeah, it depends on what. I mean, yeah, I took Bible just like you did. I mean, anybody that's

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:54.500
publicly available information, if you want to go look me up and look at my CV, anywhere available

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:59.260
online, you can see all the courses I took. Does that mean that I'm an expert on those subject

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.660
matters just because I took graduate seminars and New Testament, Old Testament, hermeneutics,

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:09.620
and so on? I'm not, doesn't make me an expert, right? So I'm conversational about these things,

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:16.760
but I'm not necessarily going to be able to tell you all the literature around this. Like you're

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:23.160
citing certain experts. I would have to kind of go back to my own notes and figure out who

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.940
actually writes. Some things that come to mind, probably somebody like Bruce Metzger or Ben

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.060
Witherington, but those, I don't know who's publishing now. I mentioned Wes Huff.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.920
Ben's probably not publishing anymore.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:40.840
Probably not. Right. So I know, I know some of these names, but again, I'm only barely

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.580
conversational about this. I can speak with a non-expert, but I'm not going to be able to have

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:51.740
a sustained conversation about these things. Fair enough. All right. So I think we were,

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.900
as far as I can tell, we're still stalled out on premise number one of the cosmological argument.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:08.340
Yeah. So what got us into discussing Genesis, and well, I think it was Exodus. Anyway, what got us

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:14.600
discussing that you brought up the idea that God changes his mind, and you thought that this was

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.100
evidence for discursive reasoning? I understand that. That's understandable, and you've got your

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:28.280
reasons to think that God can think discursively. But back to what I'm coming from, from a Catholic

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:35.680
philosopher background, God has no discursive reasoning in his mind. He is pure actuality.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:42.860
This is what I mentioned before, and that if those things are expressed in writing, those,

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:48.220
I would chalk those up to just being, you know, here are the consequences that we're laying out

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:55.460
because you, a human, and your free will took this certain route, or it would be in the manner of

00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:01.940
translating into human words that they can understand that won't God change his mind in a sense to mean,

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.020
well, you can't understand pure actuality. We're not going to get into that in Exodus and these

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:11.020
chapters. That's not the point. So we'll just very simplistically write, God changes mind.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.600
That's what got us into it.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.580
Could he have not said anything? If God didn't change his mind,

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:26.260
then you don't have to say anything. You can just say, you know, God dealt with them as he saw fit.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.540
Bada bing, bada boom, it's done.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:38.960
Yeah. Given the extreme event of commanding Abraham to sacrifice his son in all future generations,

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:45.660
you know, he had one when he was a hundred or something, um, giving that, the, the, the stakes

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:51.780
of that, um, to say nothing, to provide no explanation whatsoever, I think would be severely

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.340
lacking. I think it would confuse a lot of people.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.520
Well, I, you're talking about Genesis 22, but we were talking about Exodus 32. Genesis

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.900
22 is a different story.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:01.380
I'm talking about Exodus 32.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.820
Right. We're talking about, well, that's Moses, not Abraham, right?

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:10.340
Oh, I'm sorry. Um, so in Exodus 32, God's about to wipe out the Israelites because of the golden

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:14.720
calf incident. And he tells Moses, Hey, step aside. I'm going to wipe all these Israelites

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.860
out and I'm going to turn you into a nation because these people are stiff necked. And then Moses talks

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.720
him off the ledge. He's like, no, no, no, don't, don't do this thing. Think about the promises

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:29.300
that you made. And then it says, God changed his mind after Moses pleaded with him to change

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:36.810
his mind. Why would God go through all that if he didn't actually, uh, intend to do it? Because

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:41.870
one of two things is true. He said all that, not intending to mean it, which means he's a liar,

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:46.570
or he legitimately changed his mind, which means he changes his mind. But both of those are

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.490
contradictions to numbers 23, 19.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:54.590
I don't think so. So if, uh, if a police officer says drop the weapon or I'll shoot,

00:51:55.790 --> 00:52:05.010
like that is a claim. I will do this thing, but of course him. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. And if,

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:09.650
and if, and if he holsters his gun because you dropped the weapon, does that mean that he was

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.750
lying? No, but based on your action, he responded appropriately.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:21.790
God didn't say, do this and then I'll do that. He says, I have seen this people,

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:26.730
how stiff-necked they are. Now let me alone so that my wrath may burn hot against them,

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:31.990
that I might consume them. And of you, I will make a great nation. He didn't say if they behave,

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:37.010
if they repent, he just said, move aside. I'm going to wipe these people out. And then Moses,

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:43.170
it says, Moses implored, uh, the Lord, his God and said, Oh Lord, why does your wrath burn? And so he

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:49.070
talks them off the ledge. And then after Moses is done saying, Hey, maybe take a breather, think

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:55.170
about this for a second. Then God changes his mind. Like the whole story is quite, uh, quite reasonable.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:00.830
Once you understand how the ancient Near Eastern concepts of gods were the minute you try to

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:06.690
introduce this God that doesn't actually think in time, it falls apart because he either changed his mind

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:12.170
or he's a liar. Right. So we're getting bogged down in scripture again, but let's turn back.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:19.970
Let's turn back to what my expertise is. And it's barely an expertise. I wouldn't even cite it as an

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:27.390
expertise, but philosophy of religion. Let's assume for the sake of argument that, that, that like what

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:31.950
I'm saying, that the Catholic view just is that God can't think discursively. That's the claim.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:35.610
That's the claim is pure actuality. There is no change in God.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:40.990
But why would I think that? So why would you, why would you make an assumption in a logical

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:45.750
argument? No, no, I'm saying what, why would I, like what, if you're, if you're saying, well,

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:52.910
listen, I have this, um, you know, my conclusion is somewhat based on this idea that God doesn't

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:58.010
think recursively. Right. And I'm saying, I, I don't see a reason to believe that to be the case.

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:00.450
I'm asking you, can you support that claim with something?

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.100
I mean, I'd have to brush up on my literature on pure actuality. I can give you recommendations.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.040
You know, obviously Thomas Aquinas talks about it. There's a really good book called the one

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:23.560
and the many, uh, by W Norris Clark, who's Jesuit author and scholar. Uh, and he does, he's an evaluation

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:28.900
of Thomistic metaphysics. Uh, and he get, he gets in there. And then the other, you know, the other

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:35.140
book I often use just primary sources of Aquinas and they, uh, he was exposing Aquinas in this terms

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:41.620
of pure actuality, this, what that actually means. And as far as I understand it, and it's hard to

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:51.240
understand, um, but as far as I understand it, that if there were potentiality in God, it would impugn

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:57.240
God's sovereignty in some way. It would make it such, like we were describing earlier, that God would be

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:03.360
open to changing his mind, that that would make him sort of, some sort of dependent on other things.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.500
Uh, and of course, if God's dependent upon creatures, then he's not sovereign over creatures.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.640
Why not? Dependent upon them.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:17.740
He's not dependent on them. He's, he's allowing himself to, um, react to other things. He didn't

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.520
have to, right? Like, so in, in the worldview, I don't know if you've spent any time looking into

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.160
open theism, but, um, open theism or process theology, which is like the sister of open theism,

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:35.440
is this idea that, um, God could just completely get rid of your free will and can be 100% sovereign

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:42.020
and, uh, be the cause of all things. Or God could choose to limit himself the same way he limited

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:48.400
himself when he sent Jesus to the earth. He could limit himself and allow humans to make their own

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:55.400
decisions, uh, and then react to those decisions. But obviously, as the name implies, process theology

00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:03.400
happens as, as a process. Yeah. I took process theology to mean that God himself is a process,

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:09.160
not a substance. I'm not saying substance. I'm saying that in, in process theology, God is

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:15.340
in a partnership, uh, sort of an agreement with mankind that he, like there's an ultimate arc.

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.320
You know, the Bible says in Isaiah that God declares the end from the very beginning and they

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.040
accept that. They say, yes, that's true. God knows the ultimate end game, but, um, he is working

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:30.680
in unison with mankind to achieve those goals. He's not forcing those goals. It's a process.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:38.320
Right. Yeah. You know, um, so I know this is very, or at least in the years I was in seminary,

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:44.640
it was very fashionable among, uh, evangelicals to, to sort of explore these areas with respect

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.840
to process theology and open theism. I've even got a few books on the things and on my shelf behind me.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:57.800
Um, but as far as Catholics understand, I believe that they think them as heresies. Uh, you can,

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.360
Oh yeah, for sure.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.300
Track me on that if I'm wrong.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:56:59.780
No, you're right.

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:07.180
Uh, open theism is just recycled heresy from, uh, 16th century guy named Socinius. So it's a view

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:12.840
called Socinianism and, uh, it just recycles the same old idea. And of course they, they're going

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:19.580
to affirm. So this open theism, what it says is since the future doesn't exist, then God does

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:25.340
have omniscience. It's just that his omniscience is limited in the same way. Omnipotence, right?

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:33.360
Omnipotence is limited, uh, in the sense that God's omnipotent, but he's only all powerful in the sense

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:38.820
that he can only do the things that are logically possible to do omniscience. So, so he can't lift

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.600
like a rock that, you know, he can't create a rock that's too heavy for him to lift. Cause that's

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.280
just logically impossible. And it can't create a square circle that's logically impossible,

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:52.240
but well, I had a question. I think you're the right person for this, which is why can't God do

00:57:52.240 --> 00:58:00.310
logical impossibilities? Because a metaphysical possibility is dependent upon logical possibilities.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:04.410
So something that's logically impossible is not metaphysically impossible. Something logically

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:11.930
possible not. It, it's a weird thing because it's, it's odd to say God created logic. God

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:17.250
is logic himself in the sense of like, God is reason himself. He's ultimate rationality.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:22.030
So logic is, it would just be in his character. It's the same thing with goodness. God's identified

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:26.210
with the good. And so he couldn't do things that are contrary to his nature.

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:34.230
So God is, uh, his nature is that he does things that are logical, right? And you're

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:40.190
suggesting that because he has a particular nature logic exists, it's like a manifestation

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:44.730
of his nature. Right. What does that even mean? How does it, how does a nature manifest?

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:53.640
Right. My nature manifests in the ways I express to other people. Right. But of course, God's,

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:58.440
God's going to be unique in the sense that when he expresses his nature, it's going to have a lot

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:03.380
more authority than, you know, and a lot more implications for other people, you know? So I liken it

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:11.100
to a very fashionable view these days with respect to, um, uh, the simulation theory. Right. So many

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.520
people like to think about this. I don't, I don't think it's true, but it's, it's a fun puzzle to

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.640
think about. Suppose there's a simulator, a designer, this thing, we're all living in a simulation.

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:27.540
Um, if that guy decides to do things or have purpose for the simulation, like I can think about

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:32.260
whatever purpose I like, but it's ultimately going to depend on what, whatever the designer, the

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:37.420
simulation design for me, same thing. But like, if he wants to express certain things, like I can

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:41.480
express things all I want within the limitations that I have, that I've been designed for. But

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:49.420
if that guy wants to express something about himself to, you know, it's going to look different.

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:58.940
Does God have control over his nature? Um, what do you mean? Can, can God control, like I can't

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:03.880
control my own nature. Like I can't control the fact that I have a brain that thinks like, that's

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.700
just part of being a human. Right. But if God is all powerful, I would imagine that he has control

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:19.450
over his own nature. Like he can decide what his nature actually is. Yeah. So control, I, I, so,

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:24.410
so control is meant in a couple of ways. So control, if it's like static control, the idea

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:29.130
that I just want to control it or like govern it or just have control over something management,

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:36.530
in other words, uh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. He has that, but control for the sake of changing something.

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:39.770
Well, no, he's not going to be able to change his nature because he's unchangeable.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:45.230
So then he's not all powerful. If he can't do something, it's just definitionally true.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:51.710
He can't do something that's logically impossible to do. Right. But if he has control over logic,

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:56.130
that means if, and he, if he can't change logic, that means he's bound by it.

01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:01.150
So if he's bound by his own nature, that means he's just not all powerful. He's like mostly powerful.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:09.210
I'm sorry. I don't see the problem. The problem is definitions, right? There's no exceptions to the

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:19.000
word all. I'm sorry. Can you repeat what you think the problem is? Uh, the problem is that like

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.820
definitions in English have like, uh, definitive meanings. Like when we say something is all

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.820
encompassing, like all powerful, that just means that there's nothing he can't do. Now you're

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.580
saying, well, the reason why he can't do logical impossibilities is because somehow it's a

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:38.260
fundamental manifestation of his nature, which I didn't put the burden on you to prove. Um, not that

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:42.180
you couldn't, I'm sure you have an argument for it. What I'm suggesting though, is that, okay,

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.300
let's call it part of his nature. Okay. Well, does God not have control over his own nature?

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.820
And if God doesn't have control over his own nature, then that's just one more thing he can't

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:57.280
do. Yeah. So he can't do things that are logically impossible. I think that we just keep coming back

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:05.720
to that. So right. Because he can't control his nature. He is in control of his nature, but he can't

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.220
change his nature because he's unchangeable. That is by definition what he is. Nature, then he can't

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:17.460
do something. Which is that definitionally true. This is like saying that, you know, since God's

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:22.560
immaterial, if he can't be material, then he's not all powerful. That, that seems a really odd.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:27.180
I don't think material has anything to do with power. I mean, theoretically, if you're all

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:35.140
powerful, you should manifest materially, whatever God's attribute might be. Right. So if God's divine,

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:39.340
if it can't be not divine, then he's not all powerful. That seems a really silly kind of way of

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:45.740
arguing in my view. That's not my claim. My claim is just pure definition of words, right? You believe

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:50.300
in a God that's all powerful, but you keep telling me there are things that he can't do. You keep

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.920
telling me that he's all knowing, but the Bible says there are things he doesn't know. So like,

01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:01.260
I mean, I appreciate that you have this concept of God. I've heard it many times on this stream from

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.940
other philosophers. I just, to me, it's a nonsensical view. If God is the creator of all

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:13.260
things, that means there's not one thing he didn't create. And if he has control over all things,

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:19.640
that includes himself. And so if he doesn't have control over his own nature, then we can't say

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.520
that he is in control of all things. We can say he's in control of most things, minus one.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.860
I acknowledge that he has control over his own nature in the sense of control, authority over

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:36.460
his own nature, grasp of his own nature, management of his own nature. But if you want to talk about,

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:42.220
yeah, that's the thing. He doesn't have control in the sense of being able to change his nature.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.760
That's something he lacks. It's a power he lacks.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:50.140
Right. So when I say this is, with all due respect, I think it's not a good argument because

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:58.240
like I say, you know, God also can't commit acts of evil. Does that mean that that makes him less

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.680
powerful? But he can't do that. He's all good. In the Bible, he does. He's all good. Let's just,

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.580
okay, I'm not getting into the Bible. Let's assume, like not that I won't, but I didn't prepare for

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.660
that. But Derek, this is what I keep trying to tell you. Like the God you believe in philosophy is not

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.140
the God of the Bible. Let's just stick to the argument. Let's just stick to the argument.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:22.720
All right. Let's try to be very narrow here and focus. I think we've lost our point in the

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.560
argument. I don't know what part we're at anymore in the argument. We got rabbit trailed.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.780
Well, it's a God's attribute. So you said that since God doesn't have control over his ability to change

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:39.340
his own nature, that somehow that makes God not as powerful or he's just not all powerful.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:46.480
I think this is a silly argument, like I said. So suppose, as Christians claim, that God is

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.600
omnibenevolent. He's all good. For someone to criticize that and say, well, he can't commit

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.940
evil, so he must not be all powerful. Like that seems a very odd way of arguing. I don't think

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:01.360
it's a very good argument at all. It doesn't impugn God's power if he's not able to do certain

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:07.920
things. It's definitionally true is my argument. I'm not impugning God. I'm saying that if he can't

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:14.340
do all things, including logical impossibilities, then you have to get rid of the word all because

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:20.880
all doesn't have exceptions. Right. So if you want to get into definitions, there's not just

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.400
one kind of definition. In fact, I mean, I looked this up earlier in the logic book because I was

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.640
applying to a comment on my channel. This seems to be like a common thing. It's like, well, just think

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:37.160
about the dictionary definition. Like this eats me up as a teacher. Like it's like, you know,

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.500
if anybody starts out, for example, I'm not saying you're doing this, but everybody starts out an

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.900
essay. It's like the dictionary, dictionary.com says, you know, it's like, it's like, no, no, no,

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:49.300
because dictionary definition is only one kind of definition. So what's the alternative definition

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:56.980
of the word all? We have, let me just run through what kinds of definitions there are. So we have

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:01.820
extensional definitions, which you can have like a picking out depth kinds of definition. Like this

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.880
means this, like, so if I have an orange, for example, and you ask me, what's an orange, I just

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.580
show you, this is an orange, right? That would be a definition. It's called an ostentive definition.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.880
We've got a numerative definition where I just enumerate different kinds, uh, definitions by

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.940
subclass. And then there are intentional definitions, not intentional with the T intention,

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:27.300
but intentional with an S meaning it's internal. So by that, uh, lexical definitions fall there.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:32.960
That's your dictionary definitions. Like, uh, but there are all, there are also stipulative

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:41.280
definitions. Like let's suppose for the sake of argument, a, a gobble fart is such and such.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.480
And then I just define my thing like that, that'd be a stipulative definition. There are precising

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.260
definitions. When you have issues of vagueness, like what is baldness? What does it mean to have

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:53.960
a beard? Do you have a beard? Do I have a beard? Right. And then there are theoretical definitions

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.100
with respect to the necessary and sufficient conditions for what a thing satisfies in order

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:05.180
to be that thing. So, uh, I assume when somebody says, well, that's just what the definition of

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:11.220
X means. They're referring to the dictionary definition. Just, this means like common social

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:18.380
understanding of what a word means of received wisdom. Um, but that's not necessarily as any teacher

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:25.140
of, of composition, certainly any philosophy teacher. Uh, if a student writes, oh, dictionary

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:31.260
says this, I mean, that's not necessarily what is the best definition. Like it's just how people

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:35.500
talk. Let, let me give an example. I know how definitions work. I'm asking you, can you provide

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:47.360
a definition for the word all that has exceptions? I did. So omnipotence means all powerful with respect

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:55.440
to doing all the things that is possible for God to do. But just omnipotence is a different word.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.180
And, and again, you've created an exception to it, right? I'm talking about the word all or

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:08.240
either omnipotent or all. I think we can go with either one. And there is no exception to omnipotence.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:17.530
There's no exception to the word all it's, it's every part of the whole. Yeah. So no, no, no

01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:25.070
philosophical theologian thinks that all applies to all things. So all doesn't mean all. Okay.

01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:30.230
Just checking. That's why I said, he doesn't mean omni either, but that's what I'm saying. If you

01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:35.450
don't label, if you don't mean all, then you have to find a different word. Like if, if all,

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:42.050
if all doesn't mean all, then you needed a better word. Sure. I'm open to a better word. I'm not the

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:46.210
one who stipulated the word. I mean, this is like calling yourself an atheist and be like, well,

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.870
I'm an atheist, but I'm not this kind. I'm not this kind of this kind. It's like, well, why use the

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:56.690
word? Well, because it has utility. Sure. It applies in many different respects, but maybe not in these

01:08:56.690 --> 01:09:01.430
respects in these respects. I don't see a problem with this. You could say he's like maximal power,

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:11.710
maximally powerful. Sure. That's fine. You could say he's most powerful. I mean, yeah, I don't see

01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:16.090
why we're getting hung up on this to be, to be honest with you. I'm not getting hung up on it. I'm

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:21.290
just letting you know that the definitions like have like meanings when we're having semantic

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:27.730
discussions. And when you use words like all, and then you say there's exceptions to all, well,

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:36.250
then all is no longer an appropriate adjective. That's fine. We can change the adjective. I'm open

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:42.070
to that. I'm not the one who labeled God's attributes. I wasn't there like what a thousand

01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:48.010
years ago when these things got added. So nobody asks my opinion. I'm just using the terms that are

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:51.670
standard in the literature. And I think any theologian, any philosopher who uses these terms,

01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:56.110
they don't mean that God can do the logically impossible. So I don't think that this is a very

01:09:56.110 --> 01:10:06.530
good objection. Sure. But I agree with like just basic rationality that I don't see a good reason

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:12.250
why God wouldn't be able to change the laws of logic. If he's the one that has control over all

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:21.020
things, why can't he change them? Because he can't change his nature. Why can't he? Because another

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.520
attribute of God is unchangeable. I'm just using this, like, I'm just giving you what Christians

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:32.040
believe. I know what Christians believe. I'm asking you to support the arguments, right? So

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.020
why can't God change his nature? You want me to give you an argument for why God is unchangeable.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:35.340
Yeah.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:44.080
Because it goes back to actuality and potentiality. If God has potentiality within him,

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:49.260
that means it's possible. So if we think about this in terms of motion, something that has potential

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:55.320
motion and not actual motion is that something that is potential motion means it's not

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.160
actually currently moving. In other words, potential motion just means it's at rest. It is not

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:07.000
motion at all. So potential motion is just not motion at all. So if we say that God has potentiality,

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.800
then that actually limits God in his sovereignty and his attributes and so on. So if God is pure

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:19.620
actuality, again, I mean, I could give you people to read on this, put it in the chat if you like,

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:27.140
or in the video description, but it's W Norris Clark. I don't have it within reach, but I can go

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:32.920
back to my bookshelf if you'd like to show you what it looks like, but it's very easy to find. It's

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.580
called The One in the Mini.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.220
Our Discord friends will have it posted in about 30 seconds.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:42.800
Awesome. Awesome. The One in the Mini. It's not an easy read, but if you want to know more about

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:50.180
God's attributes with respect to pure actuality, why God has to be unchangeable, why God has to be,

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:57.560
you know, pure goodness, goodness itself, truth itself, beauty itself, all right there. So it's,

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.600
it's, it's not accessible because these ideas are not accessible. They're not, but, but I, I've met

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:09.260
people who don't like online friends who don't have a doctorate, don't even have any degree in,

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:13.280
in, in philosophy whatsoever. And they're able to pick up on these things. So for the people who

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.420
are interested, um, if they read around on this, there's plenty of literature on this.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.460
Sure. So, I mean, we've been at it for about an hour and a half. We should probably try to progress

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:29.480
our conversation as much as possible so we don't lose the entire audience. Uh, where, where did we

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.780
leave off in the actual point of discussion? Somehow we, we started the cosmological argument

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:43.180
and we got, we got lost in the middle of it. Yeah. So I don't even think we were in the middle.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.580
I don't think we were either. Yeah. We were somewhere near the beginning.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:53.770
You know, I, I suppose I could share screen on this. Couldn't I? I think you can. I don't

01:12:53.770 --> 01:13:00.190
know if anyone can see it, but we'll see what happens if you try it. Yeah. I mean, I can probably

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:05.270
manipulate it. No, that's the argument that I, hold on. Let me see if I can put it on screen.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:12.540
I can put it on screen. It's going to be rather small, but I can blow it up though. Hold on. Go

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.440
ahead. I'm listening. Okay, cool. Yeah. It's going to be rather small, but that's, that's the idea.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.500
Um, I think we were only at, well, I think, I don't even think where we were, but premise one

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.840
is just going to be, this is an empirical observation, uh, causes happen, cause and effect.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.000
I look out into the world. I see the causes are happening. Uh, I would look at that. Some people

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.980
are going to deny that causation happens like Hume, David Hume. Some people are going to be like,

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:42.720
oh, well, we can't know of the world that exists outside our minds. Um, those people are going to

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.560
have issues with this premise, but I think for most common sense people, they're going to be like,

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.960
yeah, movement, causation, things are happening outside of me. Sure. Nothing exists prior to

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:59.220
itself. Uh, this is just a, uh, a metaphysical reality, I think. So this is unobjectionable.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.600
I don't disagree with premise two, but yeah, but I think this is where you and I differ,

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:09.400
right? Is you're assuming I think it's the series, right? Yeah. You're, you're assuming that it didn't

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.740
exist prior to itself and then God made it exist. But then I would push back. I would say, well,

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.300
first of all, I don't believe that to be the case. We already talked about that. But secondly,

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:25.200
you would have to explain why God isn't somehow special pleading, right? So if the universe can't

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:31.180
exist prior to itself, then, uh, and live in an infinite regress, then how is it that God can't?

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:36.640
And then we got into the whole nonsense discussion about God actually living within time,

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.880
because as far as I can tell, there can be no sequencing of any types of events without time.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.900
And that's why I resisted that by saying that, and this goddess, this is what I think triggered the

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:52.760
whole side quest of looking into the Bible, discursive reasoning, all that is because I

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.600
resisted that by saying that, uh, thing if, if God exists outside of time, that's not the only view

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:07.000
that you could have. But if God exists outside of time, then, uh, then there wouldn't be any change

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.840
in God. This is just one of the, uh, risk just well known attributes of God among Christian

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:20.920
theologians is he's unchangeable, impassable. He can't be affected. Yeah. Immutable. Yeah.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.480
So that's what got us off track. Um, special pleading. Let's talk about that. I think,

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:36.730
I think that, and I had a video on this about how the atheist special pleads and a lot of people

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:41.270
didn't like that. A lot of people didn't like that because I think that there could be some

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:49.430
special pleading here. You know, not all atheists are the same kind of person, but I think that,

01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:59.730
uh, if the atheist, for example, denies, uh, the principle of cause and effect, then you don't get

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:08.410
this, right? Uh, so, so for example, have I denied the principle cause and effect? In fact, I, I'm,

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:14.090
right. I'm insisting that cause and effect actually happens and it's been happening infinitely, which is,

01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:18.910
I mean, theoretically, the only way God could have spoke things into his existence, he spoke it and

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:24.430
then it happened cause and effect. So in that, in that case, I would, I would say, look,

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:30.550
I think you have a special case of special pleading because you're saying that, um, for all other

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.970
things, you know, we like to use empirical observation, but for this, it's okay. We don't

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:40.130
need it. It's just that we don't, we don't know if it's always been, uh, ad infinitum into the past

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:43.970
internally into the past that cost effects have been happening, but we just think that it is.

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:48.910
All right. What I'm saying is all the evidence we have points towards that. Like I don't have any

01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:54.310
evidence that would point me towards the fact that once nothing existed, I have no evidence of that.

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.010
All I can do is use the evidence I have.

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:04.730
I think, I think the opposite here. So, so I don't, I don't want us to be at an impasse,

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:09.270
but I think that all the evidence points towards, uh, an ultimate beginning in the big bang.

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:15.430
I think science disagrees. They don't disagree about the big bang.

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:20.770
They, they agree that the big bang happened. They disagree with the claim that there was nothing

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:27.510
prior to it. Right. So here's the thing, like that, the originator of the big bang theory was

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:32.850
a Catholic priest. He did not think that there was, that it, that just, it just continued on and

01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:37.230
on and on and on, or that the big bang happened. There was nothing that caused it. These sort of

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:43.250
atheist proposals. They, so, so the originator of the theory himself, you know, for whatever

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:48.190
that's worth, I'm not saying it's worth everything, but for somebody who knew what he was talking

01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:52.790
about, he thought that these things were, maybe he thought that the evidence led to God.

01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:55.870
Well, yeah, because he existed before modern cosmology.

01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:00.270
Modern cosmology does not disprove God.

01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:05.030
I didn't say it did. I'm saying that the, the opinion of the person you're appealing to

01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:10.490
lived at a time where he doesn't know what we know now, just like people at the early

01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:16.110
days of, of learning human biology don't know what we know now. Yeah. They did some great

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:21.490
anatomy field work, but we know infinitely more today than they knew a hundred years ago.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.900
Yeah. So I don't, I don't think that knowing more about cosmology would make you not believe

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:35.100
in God. Because again, I think that, so let's imagine, I don't know if you said anything with

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:41.040
respect to the multiverse, but, or let's just imagine infinite series, whatever those things

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.380
are, it would get us into the third way with respect to contingency. Like those things are

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:49.940
contingent things. We have no other reason to think that they're otherwise. I mean, I know you

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:56.420
want to resist that and that's fine. No, I didn't deny that the, that the, the items within our

01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:02.200
universe are contingent. I'm just saying that it's an infinite cause. Oh, the universe as a whole. No,

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:08.500
it's just a brute. Yeah. See, that's unsatisfying to me. But we know that you don't say, you're just

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:14.500
saying God is a brute fact. And I'm saying the thing we know exists, the stuff we know for a fact exists

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:20.200
is a brute fact. You're saying, no, no, no, I don't like that brute fact. So I'm going to appeal to a

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:28.110
different brute fact that I have no evidence exists. That's see, see the thing. I don't think

01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:34.090
those are similar whatsoever. I don't think God is a brute fact. Okay. Then you'd have to demonstrate

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:41.830
why I would accept, accept the God claim. So, so the brute fact is the idea that here's something I

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:46.830
have no evidence for it whatsoever. It's just an assumption. I'm proven hypothetical speculation

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:52.430
here. That's a brute fact. I can't tell you why, but it just is. That's not what I'm doing with God.

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:58.250
But you haven't provided a single reason why we need a God. What does God, what problem does God

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:01.430
solve? Because as far as I can tell, he creates more problems than he solves.

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:11.370
I mean, you could perhaps allege that me saying that an infinite regress is impossible is a brute fact.

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:17.150
That I'd be okay with. But I get to God's existence by saying an infinite regress is impossible.

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:20.410
And that's an inference. That's not a brute fact.

01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:26.470
Yeah, but why is it impossible? Like, so we've done this before. And again, I have the infinite

01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:32.650
regress argument about 4,000 times. And it never ends where you want it to end. It's never going to

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:35.310
end in me accepting that infinite regresses are impossible.

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:36.850
Because infinite regress never ends.

01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:44.690
You got it. And so the reality is that you either do or you don't accept that infinite

01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:50.390
regresses are or are not possible. And I can't see a good reason to believe that they're not

01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:54.370
possible. I've never seen a good argument for it. And I've seen the argument. I've heard the

01:20:54.370 --> 01:21:00.570
domino argument. I've heard Hilbert's Hotel. I know all the typical arguments that are used. I don't

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:06.570
find any of them to be convincing. And everything I know from science would point me towards the fact

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.690
that we do have an infinite regress.

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:15.750
So let me ask this. Now, I'll have to wrap up here because I've got an appointment I got to get you

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:22.690
at the top of the hour. But do you think everything has to have a cause?

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:27.790
I think everything does have a cause. And I think it's an infinite regress of causes again.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:38.140
So that seems nonsensical to me, only for the fact that how does an infinite regress cause itself?

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:42.440
And if you want to say it, would you say that an infinite regress causes itself? Just to break it

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:42.620
down.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.320
Well, an infinite regress isn't a thing. An infinite regress is an idea.

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.600
It's the process of things that are causing themselves.

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.640
Right. But processes aren't things that exist. They're descriptions of how things behave.

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.020
Sure.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:59.040
Right. It's like the scientific method isn't the thing that exists. It's a description of

01:21:59.040 --> 01:21:59.920
a process, right?

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.640
Sure. I agree with you.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.440
So I don't think an infinite regress needs a cause because it's not a thing.

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:17.140
But that an infinite regress, the process could just be infinitely long to have no beginning.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.120
That's what you think.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:22.300
Yeah. I think that's parsimony is with what we know from science.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:27.340
Now, listen, we might discover something down the road. We might learn 25 years from now that

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:32.080
that's not true. That as it turns out, we find definitive evidence that prior to the Big Bang,

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.640
there was absolutely nothing. Well, that information hasn't occurred. We don't have that

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:41.540
evidence. All the evidence points to the contrary. And if we did have that evidence, to me, it still

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:47.220
wouldn't point me towards the God. I would still posit a naturalistic phenomenon that caused the

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:52.500
initial moment, right? So even if we accepted that there was an initial moment, we have no reason to

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.880
accept that it was caused by a God.

01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:02.220
Yeah. So why would you then go back to a naturalistic explanation?

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.220
Because it's—

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.780
Why the resistance to a supernatural?

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:10.180
Because it's easier to explain with less entailments, right? Once you include a God,

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:15.200
now you've got entailments. You've got something that is a thinking agent that has a mind,

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:20.400
will, and emotions, and desires, right? And then you have to explain those desires. This is where we

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:27.020
get into the problem of natural evil, right? Like, okay, now if we're going to say a God is

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:33.000
responsible for it, we've got a lot of unexpected things coming from this new God that invented

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:41.140
everything. Like, why does he create a world that has infinite suffering? For example, earthquakes,

01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:47.680
volcanoes, tsunamis, these things don't really serve a purpose. These are unnecessary sources of

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.160
suffering.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.880
As far as we know.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.540
Can you think of why they're needed?

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.300
Because I'm a human? No, I cannot.

01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:57.380
Right. Exactly.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.520
What this argument assumes is that we humans know better than God that God has no reason for this,

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.820
and that's a big leap that's not substantiated.

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.100
Could God accomplish the goals without them?

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.240
I'm not God. I don't know.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.460
If he can't, then he's not all powerful.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.920
So to your point, well, that's not necessarily true.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:22.520
Sure it is.

01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:28.880
So Leibniz has a view on which, like, he talks about the best universe that could exist,

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.680
and it's not going to be the one without any suffering whatsoever.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:33.080
Why didn't say anything about all suffering?

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.420
This is his response to the problem of evil.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.180
Right. So this is his response to the problem of evil.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.920
I'm talking about earthquakes.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.360
Natural suffering or evil.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.240
Natural phenomenon.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.000
That's what I meant.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.320
No, no. Evil is like something humans do. Like, you insult somebody and you ruin their day.

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:48.800
I'm talking about hurricanes.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.920
Natural evil, hurricanes, earthquakes, and so on. I understand. Yeah. So Leibniz,

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:59.580
his response to the problem of evil, is to say that God, in his infinite wisdom,

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:05.000
would know how to balance out all the things such that there would be the lowest amount of evil things,

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:10.760
natural and human evil, and the highest amount of good in the world. Right? So like he would just

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:18.220
know what balance of those things would be. If it's such that having maximal good in a world

01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:28.200
with no evil would end up being less good than having a little bit of evil and a little less good,

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.020
right? Because we know that good can come from evil.

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.080
We know that good can come from evil.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.200
When people are in earthquakes and tsunamis, like we shouldn't take them to the hospital.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.860
Like, aren't we intervening with God's desires?

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:44.740
No.

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:45.380
Okay.

01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:45.960
That's non sequitur.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.760
So the natural disasters, what are they good for? What do we need them for?

01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:53.130
I don't know.

01:25:53.610 --> 01:26:00.050
Okay. That's what I'm saying. Natural disasters are an unexpected reality where there's an all good,

01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:00.830
all powerful about.

01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:04.970
You're not agnostic about this. You're making some outlandish claims about, with all due respect,

01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:10.630
some claims that are unsubstantiated. Hey, I as a human know that God has no reason for this,

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:12.310
and even if he did, his reasons are really bad.

01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:17.150
I didn't say that. What I'm saying is if God couldn't accomplish, like, if God needs to send

01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:24.710
a, whatever, a tornado through Mississippi, if he needs to do that to accomplish his goals,

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:30.310
then you're implying that he couldn't have accomplished his goals without the tornado,

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:34.830
right? Is that the implication?

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.210
I suppose there are—I mean, given that the tornado was contingent, there are other ways

01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:41.230
to accomplish his goals. It might include a different tornado, it might include a different

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:45.830
disaster, it might include just no disaster at all. I'm not God. I don't know. I'm not omniscient.

01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:51.430
But if we presume that God sent the tornado because he needed outcome X, Y, and Z, right?

01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:55.270
Could he achieve outcome X, Y, and Z without the tornado?

01:26:57.190 --> 01:27:00.230
I mean, I don't think the tornado is necessary. I think it's contingent, so—

01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:06.010
You nailed it. It's not necessary. It's unnecessary disaster, unnecessary suffering.

01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:09.810
The minute you tell me that tornadoes are not necessary, they become unnecessary.

01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:13.330
Now, I know you think that was a clever admission, but it was not.

01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:15.690
It was a great admission. I'm glad you finally gave it to me.

01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:20.570
No, because if you recall what I just said earlier, it could have been that tornado,

01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:22.070
it could have been a different one, it could have been an earthquake, it could have been

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.470
no tornado or earthquake whatsoever, it could have been anything, because those things are

01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.910
contingent.

01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:26.690
But then it'd be necessary.

01:27:26.890 --> 01:27:32.430
God could see that he brings it about. Does everything God do, is it necessary?

01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:33.310
That's what I'm saying.

01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:35.050
I think the creation of the world is contingent.

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:37.290
Well, when God is doing things—

01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:40.550
He would very well have created nothing in the world whatsoever. But if God has certain

01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:45.710
purposes, certain aims, certain goals, such that the maximal amount of good could be brought

01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:53.990
about in the world, then those are his aims, and he will do things that go towards those aims.

01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:54.990
That's my point, yeah.

01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:58.910
So it could be this, it could be that, it could be another thing, but—so each one of those

01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:59.750
things is contingent.

01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:04.530
That's what I'm saying. God is doing something to achieve his goals. And we, in your worldview,

01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:09.870
the natural disasters are something that God obviously needs to achieve his goals. So

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:16.090
if he needs them, then they're necessary, right? But if he needs them, then you're suggesting he

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:21.450
couldn't do it another way. If he could do it another way, then they're no longer necessary.

01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:26.510
Yeah, that's not what philosophers mean by necessity. Like, I'm talking about metaphysical

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.850
necessity.

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:30.250
I'm not talking about metaphysical necessity. I'm talking about God's ability.

01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:36.710
So I'm, I'm, I am denying that these are necessary, and I'm affirming that they are

01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:41.890
contingent with respect to metaphysical necessity. Obviously, they're not necessary like that. Like,

01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:45.450
the reality of numbers and mathematical truths, logical truths, those things are

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:46.870
just necessary.

01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:48.130
So God doesn't need them.

01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:54.030
It could possibly be otherwise. The, the events in the world, contingent, empirical events, no.

01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:58.710
The natural disasters. Okay. So God doesn't need to use natural disasters to accomplish his goals,

01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.950
right?

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.180
I don't know. I'm not God. Like, you're trying to get me to say, you're trying to get me to say,

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:11.760
with respect to me being a human and make, that's like getting an aunt to say, Hey, why do you think

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.740
these people moved into this house? You know, like, what, why do you think their goals were?

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.340
Like, why would they do it that way? Cause they have done it. That's, it's just ridiculous.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.100
That's why I started the conversation with, it's an unexpected reality, given your framework,

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:30.660
given the framework that there is an all loving, all knowing, all powerful entity that is also,

01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:36.640
uh, wanting to accomplish his goals. If, if he can't do it without a natural disasters,

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:41.900
then somehow he's bound and he's not all powerful. If he can do it with the natural disasters,

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:46.340
but doesn't have to, then that means the natural disasters aren't needed to accomplish his goals,

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:50.120
which means it's just unnecessary suffering. It's not actually all good. You've got a Mexican

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.920
standoff with the Omni properties. Yeah, I don't think so. And if you want to talk about the,

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.120
the problem of evil, there's a logical problem of evil, which is what you're discussing.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.380
The idea that there's this magic Mexican standoff, in other words, that they're logically

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.500
inconsistent somewhat. And then, so that's the logical problem of evil. Then you have the

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:13.360
evidential, no, sorry, sorry. The existential problem of evil that more of like human suffering

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.080
in general, I'm going through something hard. And so I find it really hard to believe that God

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.800
exists. The logical problem of evil. If you read philosophers of religion, they consider the

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:26.140
logical problem of evil to be resolved. It's not a problem at all. Like even atheist philosophers

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:31.120
will say this. Yes, there are atheist philosophers of religion, like Graham Obby. There's not a lot,

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:36.160
but there are a few. The logical problem of evil is considered to be solved. The existential problem

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:42.560
of evil, that of suffering is still open. Like people going through a really hard time, getting

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.020
cancer, losing their job, whatever it may be, they find it really hard. They find it really hard

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:54.080
to believe that God exists. And so it's not finding it hard to believe. What I'm saying is it's

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.660
inconsistent with the attributes that are given to God.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:02.780
Like, yeah. So if, if you want to do more reading on this and I'm sorry, I've got to go,

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:09.500
but, um, I would recommend reading, uh, Eleanor Stump. She's a emeritus professor of philosophy

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:16.600
at, uh, St. Louis university. Uh, she's a Catholic philosopher herself, uh, very, uh, imminent

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.520
and well-known. And she's written a book. I think it came out in 2012. I think, uh, Oxford

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.860
university press is called walking in darkness. It's an examination of look at the problem

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:30.080
of suffering. So, and in that, of course, she's got to set it up. So in that, she also

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:34.180
talks about the logical problem of evil. So this would be a good reference to go look

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:34.940
at both if you like.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.360
Sure. And I'll be definitely engaging in some philosophy this year. It's not really where

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.920
I spend most of my time because I don't think it provides you with, with, uh, solutions

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:50.900
that are, um, we'll say the average person cares to hear about. Um, but that being said,

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:56.040
you know, if, if we find these instances where to say, okay, God has these attributes and then

01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:01.360
we look at the world around us and say, are these attributes consistent with our observations?

01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:05.780
If they're not consistent, then I'm inclined to believe that those attributes can't be the

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:06.140
case.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:13.320
Yeah, that's totally understandable. Um, and just with respect to like these high level

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:20.580
heady conversations, I myself don't always find them all that, uh, enjoyable, you know,

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.300
because they're hard work, I think, but I think doing the hard work, reading the philosophy,

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.800
that sort of thing that I don't always do. Uh, I think some people may think that, I don't know

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.740
what would give them the impression that I'm always reading, but I'm not, uh, I've got to turn

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.020
it off sometimes too, because you got to go out and live your life. You got to have real everyday

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:46.220
conversations. Uh, but I think doing the hard work is, uh, it's worthwhile. It's, it's worth it. And

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:50.520
like examining what philosophers, what theologians have said about these things that we've discussed

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:56.180
here today, that it, the payoff then comes in the everyday conversations, being able to say,

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.240
okay, well, I understand it this way. What do you think? And so on and so on.

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:04.800
Yeah. Well, listen, um, Dr. McAllister, I enjoyed the conversation. I know that this is,

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:10.560
um, a contentious conversation for a lot of people and you've been incredibly cordial

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:15.860
and, um, you've even tolerated me talking over you a few times, which you don't have to,

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:20.780
you didn't have to do that. I grew up with like a family of five kids, so I'm used to it.

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:24.520
Yeah. I was the youngest of eight. Like that, this is our love language is yelling at each other.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.980
Exactly. Exactly. You don't get heard all the time. This is why we're on YouTube, right?

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:35.500
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, but so I appreciate you coming in and being cordial and, um, and so,

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:42.640
you know, big W for coming in and, uh, do come back because, um, you were one of the few philosophers

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:49.420
that came in and didn't try to bury the conversation in jargon. And that those are conversations that go

01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.620
nowhere. They're, they're not helpful for me or the audience or anyone else.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.560
Well, I appreciate that. I'd love to be back. Um, got to run now, but, uh, we'll set it up again

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.220
soon. Do you have my email and, uh, I look forward to it. All right. Take care, man.
