00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
Hello, hello. How is Jesus as a liar? Go ahead.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.600
Fantastic. I will start easy. We can start in Matthew 16, and then we'll move on from there.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.420
Have you read the book of Matthew?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.080
Uh, yeah, some of it. Do I need to get my other phone for this?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.360
Nah, put it on the screen.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.540
Okay.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.300
All right, so this is Jesus talking to some of his disciples. He says,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.060
The Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everybody for what has been done.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.220
Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.580
Now, the question I have is, how many of those people tasted death?

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.450
I don't know.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.290
All of them.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.870
Yeah, all of them, yeah. Did he come back with all the angels and judge everybody?

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.350
I mean, he hasn't came back yet, though.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.350
Right. That makes it a lie, yeah, because he says that he's going to do it before all of the people standing there have passed away.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.370
What about the 70 A.D.?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.690
Okay, well, okay, but...

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.470
Hold on, hold on, Luis.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.390
What about their descendants? What about their descendants of these people?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.650
What about them?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.250
Okay, their descendants still exist. The whole entire bloodlines couldn't possibly get wiped out.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.770
He didn't say your descendants will be alive. He says there is some literally standing here who will not taste death.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.670
Right.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.410
That doesn't prove that he's a liar, though.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.610
It is. Did he say these words?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.430
Standing there means service. I just wanted to help you.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.030
Okay, okay, okay. So, what is the context of this verse exactly?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.550
The context is he's talking about his second coming.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.460
Okay. Go to the next item.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.080
He was talking about right there. Go to the next item.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.600
Standing there right now wouldn't taste death.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.280
All right, go to the next item, then, because I don't believe this to be true.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.300
Okay, well, interpret the passage. What's it mean if it doesn't mean what it says?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.180
For the son of the man is to come with his angels and the glory of his father, then he will repay everyone for what has been done.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.680
Truly, I tell you, there are nothing standing here who will not taste death before he sees.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.360
Okay? Like, it doesn't change nothing. Like, he's still coming back.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.140
Is it true, though? Is this passage true?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.230
28.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.230
Yes, it's true.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.830
Okay, so then tell me, when did he come back and judge mankind?

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.330
He hasn't came back yet.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.110
Okay, then it's a lie, because he says,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.810
Truly, I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death, but they all taste the death.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.410
Well, you're just pulling things out if you're, like...

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.690
I'm just reading the book. The book says there are some standing here who will not taste death before he comes back again, and then they all tasted death and he didn't come back.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.790
So it's a lie.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.630
You think he's still alive? It was over 2,000 or whatever years ago. I mean, come on.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.750
Okay.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.770
You think he's alive?

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.030
They said it's for me to cope in a chat.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.930
Yes, this is called coping, yep.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.130
I'm not coping.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.010
Yeah, you're saying the words don't mean what the words mean. That's coping.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.690
No, it's not. You're just twisting them to make it up.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.050
Okay, then what do they mean? If they don't mean what I told you, then what do they mean?

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.250
Like, these people, who are these people that he's referencing to?

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.850
His disciples.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.470
You want to read further back in the chapter?

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.870
Yeah.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.750
He's talking to his disciples.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.210
Jesus foretells his death and resurrection, which isn't actually in the text.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.930
That's just a heading.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.750
It says,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.710
God forbid, Lord.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.150
And then, in 24, it gets even deeper.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.490
It says,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.830
Jesus told his disciples, he's still talking to his main disciples,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.370
if any wish to come after me and let him deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.830
For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who want to lose their lives,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.390
I'm sorry, those who lose their life for my sake will find it.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.210
For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.630
Or what will they give in return for their life?

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.150
And then he says about to his disciples,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.450
for the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.270
and then he will repay everybody for what has been done.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.510
So, it directly follows.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.930
He says, if you seek to maintain your life, you will lose it.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.570
He's saying, this is the behavior I need you to do.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.610
I need your behavior to be on the heavenly things.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.690
And then he says, he's going to come back, and he's going to do what?

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.890
He's going to judge everybody.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.130
That's Matthew chapter 25 and 26.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.490
And this is going to happen before some of them standing there taste death.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.330
Okay, go to the next verse after this.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.210
Go to the verse.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.990
That's the last word of the chapter is Son of Man coming in his kingdom.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.710
This is what you call bullshit that you're pushing.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.190
I'm not pushing anything.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.550
I just read the text, and you don't like what the text says.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.930
What version are you reading?

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.150
I'm reading the NRSV, but it says the same in every version.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.400
NRSV?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.840
Yep.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.720
Okay.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.620
Then how about you go to the KJV or the NIV then?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.420
Well, the NIV is trash, and so is the KJV.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.600
But just for you, I'll pull it up anyways.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.540
Okay, new KJV then.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.960
Actually, the new KJV is okay.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.980
I like the new KJV.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.060
Go to that one then.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.420
Because, like, you're just twisting up things.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.700
I didn't twist anything.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.740
I just read you the passage.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.800
In the New King James Version, it says,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.720
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.260
and then he will reward each according to his works.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.060
Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.000
until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.140
So it's still a lie.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.430
Yeah, you're just full of bullshit.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.790
Okay, then tell me what word here doesn't mean what it says.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.190
I'll be burning hell.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.410
This is all they got.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.150
I read the book to them, and they get so up in their fifis that they want to start cursing me.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.790
Isn't it wild that reading the Bible gets you so upset?

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.590
Why does reading the Bible upset you?

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.710
Why do you hate God's word?

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.810
I don't.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.030
What are you talking about?

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.410
You're just, like, spreading bullshit.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.790
Get out of here.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.990
You're up here crying.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.050
If you're in real life, I'll slap the shit out of you.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.670
No, you wouldn't.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.220
Why are you so triggered, man?

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.980
I'm not triggered.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.680
He's triggered.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.900
You're not triggered.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.160
We got that Christian love.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.180
What is 1 John 3?

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.080
It says if you hate a brother, the light is not in you.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.900
And then Jesus says that if you call your brother a fool, you'll be liable to the hellfire.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.020
Don't you know that what you're supposed to be exhibiting is love, and you're not doing that?

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.960
I don't have to do that, because Moses said, I for I.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.520
Oh, so you don't care what Jesus said, then?

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.600
No, I care about them, but I'm telling you that none of these are straightforward.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.080
So do you think the words of Moses should be binding?

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.840
Yes.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.400
Okay, fantastic.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.240
You want to read some of the words of Moses with me?

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.160
Where are you going with this?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.900
I'm about to read.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.140
You like the words of Moses.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.980
You brought them up.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.520
I'm going to read you some words of Moses that you might not know.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.620
Okay, you're going to bring up some monkey foolery.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.540
As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:10.460
You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you and from their families who are with you, who have been born in your land.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.500
They may be your property.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.560
You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:23.060
These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.980
So you're a cool slavery then.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:25.720
Oh, no.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.460
Wait, go back up to this verse.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.720
Go back up to this verse.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.620
It's all on the screen.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.020
No, scroll back up.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.080
Everything that I just read is on the screen right now.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.280
No, no, scroll back up.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.220
No, go back up.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:36.640
Up to what?

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.680
What verse do you want to read?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:37.980
Right there.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.620
There I go.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.740
Okay, because I had to take a screenshot of that because you're acting like a stupid monkey up here.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840
What is your problem, man?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.700
Okay, so you're cool with slavery then?

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.240
No, I'm not cool with it.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.940
Okay, but you said the words of Moses are binding and Moses said you can own slaves.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:54.900
Yes.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.920
Okay, so why aren't you cool with slavery when God said it's okay?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.780
Because in modern day times, I can't own you as a slave.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.240
So why?

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.980
I didn't say can't.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.760
Necro, thank you so much for the galaxy.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.220
I didn't say you can or can't.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.440
I'm asking whether or not it should be permissible.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.960
Do you think that it's morally permissible to own slaves?

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.420
Fucking cunt.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.940
Look at this guy.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.320
He's really crashing out.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.260
You know you're being recorded for all of history on six different social media platforms?

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:29.370
Okay.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.790
There are hundreds of thousands of people that will see this conversation over the course of time.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.290
What does that got to do with me?

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.370
I'm just letting you know that everything you do is being recorded for your posterity.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:46.650
Your children and your children's children will see you crashing out for Christ on somebody else's life, acting like an absolute child.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.710
Don't everybody record on lives.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.550
I do.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.010
Come on up.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.770
I record mine.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.010
Everybody does it.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:52.630
Like what?

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:53.150
Good.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.050
I'm so triggered though.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:54.610
Yeah.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.370
Because you're spreading.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.250
So you don't actually like the words of Moses then, do you?

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.530
I do.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:02.970
What?

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.310
But you don't like the ones about slavery.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.790
All he's doing is reading your book and you're saying that that's the BS he's spreading.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.110
No, because he's spreading nonsense on his app.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.730
I read it.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.030
He's showing you literally the Bible in front of his page.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.410
Like what?

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.690
What is he trying to trick you?

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.550
All I did was read you the book.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.230
Well, okay.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.450
He has so many versions.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.410
That doesn't mean nothing.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.170
Different versions just the way other people wrote it.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.390
You want to read it in the King James?

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.270
Would that make you feel better?

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.150
What am I?

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:34.790
A child?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.690
Get a grip.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.070
You're the one that can't handle the version that I'm using.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.890
You're being very, very offensive and everything.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.530
I don't know why.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.470
No, because it's God.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.970
Because he knows he's getting cooked right now.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.150
No, because you're spreading.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.250
Because he has no idea what he's talking about, which is why his screen name is Yahusha, which

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.470
isn't the name of anybody.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.310
What?

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.270
Yahusha is not a name of God.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.280
No.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.460
That's why I don't like talking to atheists like you.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.540
I will bet you money you can't find Yahusha in the Bible.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.040
Bro, you're just an idiot.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.840
You're just literally an idiot, man.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.720
It's all he's got.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.760
It's all he's got is name-calling and incredulity.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.020
And what is this?

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.020
What is this that you're pulling up God?

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.340
You think you look good right now?

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.380
What is this that you're pulling up right now?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.540
You think you're making Jesus look good?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.380
Rewriting history.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.900
You think you're making Jesus look good right now?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.420
He reads Hebrew.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.060
Yahusha, do you think you're making Jesus look good?

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.280
All right.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.160
Let's read some more of the words of Moses, Yahusha.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.520
I'm not Jesus.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.520
I am my own person.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.300
I'm sure you are.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.880
Yahusha, you want to read some more words of Moses since you like him so much?

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.840
All right.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.300
This is Deuteronomy 22.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.020
It says, suppose a man marries a woman, but after going into her, dislikes her and makes

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.460
up charges against her, slandering her by saying, I married this woman, but when I lay with

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.260
her, I did not find evidence of her virginity.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.700
What is the evidence that he would be expecting?

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.730
I'm not answering this.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.650
The evidence is very clear.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:20.990
He's expecting her to bleed, which is why when they go to the court, it says, the father

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.130
and now he's made up charges against her saying, I didn't find evidence of your daughter's

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.630
virginity, but here is the evidence of my daughter's virginity.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.070
Then they will spread out the cloth before the elders.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.370
So the evidence is whether or not she bled on the sheet, right?

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.390
You want foul, disgusting man.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.050
You know what I'm saying?

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.390
I'm reading your book to you.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.370
So according to your book, the evidence is whether or not she bled on a sheet, right?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.570
I'm leaving this panel.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.640
Your book, he didn't want to read the book, guys.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.020
I don't know what to tell you.
