00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Guest: Can you hear me?

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.960
Justin: Yeah, I can hear you.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.760
Guest: Okay, so when I prove you wrong, I want you to say to your life, I'm sorry.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.360
I won't.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.640
All right?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.260
You won't.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.840
Perfect, all right.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.800
I know.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.980
Justin: Every Christian I talk to is the only Christian doing it right, and I'm sure you're about

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.640
to crash out in like five seconds.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.140
So are you at least 18?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.540
Guest: Yes.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.580
Justin: Fantastic.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.400
And do you know that the Bible condones slavery?

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.280
Guest: No it doesn't.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.140
So let's go back to Genesis chapter 15 verses 13 to 16.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.500
Justin: This is going to be painful, so I'll just read it for you since you haven't read it.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.380
It's okay.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.360
I got it right here.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.860
I read it.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.720
I'm sure you have.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.220
Fantastic.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.160
As for your male and female slaves you may have, it is from the nations around you that

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.920
you may acquire male and female slaves.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.580
You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.320
who are with you who have been born in your land.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.240
They may be your property.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.640
You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.180
as property.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.720
Now, what do you call it when you own another human being as property?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.460
Slavery.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.600
Oh, slavery.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.900
The Bible condones slavery.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.340
So now I want you to issue an apology.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.860
Guest: No, let me finish speaking though.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.920
Justin: Oh, let me, we'll try this again.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.000
And does owning another human being make them a slave?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.460
Yes.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.060
Okay, did God just say, these are the slaves you may own?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.080
Guest: Okay, can I finish speaking?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.160
Justin: Did God just say, these are the slaves?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.220
Did God say, did God say, did God say you can own these slaves?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.570
Guest: He said it for a reason.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.570
Justin: Did he say, did he say you can do it?

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.710
Guest: Yes, for a reason.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.370
Justin: Okay, so then God condones slavery.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.350
That's literally what I said.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.550
the Christian God condones.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.370
For a reason.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.990
Thank you.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.010
Okay, so now I want you to issue an apology before we move on to your next talking point.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.110
Guest: Can we, okay, I'll say sorry for that, yes, God does condone for a reason.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.710
Justin: Fantastic.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.110
So now we got to talking point number two, God allows slavery and you think you've got

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.950
a good reason for it.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.070
Guest: For a reason, for a reason.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.850
Yes, for a reason.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.230
By the way, can we agree that he's speaking to the Israelites in that verse, yes or no?

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.930
Justin: Yeah, God is speaking to Moses in order to speak to the Israelites.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.710
Guest: To the Israelites, perfect, all right.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.670
Justin: Go to Genesis 15.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.010
Genesis 15 is going to cook you, you're not going to like this at all.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.530
Guest: 13 to 16.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.230
13 to 16.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.290
You're going to hate this.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.090
All right, perfect, all right.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.730
Justin: This is not going to go the way you think it is.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.130
As the sun was going down and a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a deep and terrifying

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.770
darkness descended upon him, then the Lord said to Abram, know this for certain that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.190
your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs and they shall be slaves there.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.350
They shall be oppressed for 400 years, although it's technically 430 years.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.350
Guest: Yep, 435 if you want to be exact, but he's talking about the Israelites, they're going

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.690
Justin: to be.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.250
Actually, I think it's 430.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.710
I mean, I'm pretty sure it is.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.450
Guest: But he's speaking to the, he's saying that the Israelites are going to be enslaved, correct

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.870
or yes?

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.270
He's speaking about the Israelites, correct or not?

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.990
Justin: He's talking about the Israelites serving in Egypt.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.370
Guest: Perfect, okay, then when we go back to the same verse you were talking about previous,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.350
he's allowing the Israelites to have slaves up to six years.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.650
Justin: Yeah, it says the time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.050
Alright, apology, apology number two, let's have it.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.850
Guest: Okay, I'm sorry for that, yeah, 430, I'm sorry, wow.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.210
Justin: Fantastic, okay, alright, now back to your bad talking point.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.170
So what about Exodus?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.210
Guest: So back to your verse, correct?

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.350
Justin: Which one?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.390
Guest: It's the previous one he gave me, correct?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.510
Justin: Leviticus 25.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.010
Guest: Yes.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.850
Alright, what about it?

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.250
He's telling the Israelites that they have the right to own a slave up to six years and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.650
free them the seventh year, yes or no?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.370
Justin: Citation needed, you're lying.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.870
Guest: Go back to the verse then, go back to the verse.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.650
Justin: I got it right here, you're not going to like it.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.270
I love how confident these people come in having not read the book.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.330
Alright, so show me in Leviticus 25 where it says anything about going free in the seventh

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.850
year.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.910
Guest: Here.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.770
Justin: You're confusing Exodus 21 with Leviticus 25 by the way, just be clear.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.250
Guest: Give me one sec, I was eating.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.820
Justin: It's wild how often Christians get spanked on this topic considering they've got the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.940
power of the Holy Spirit.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.720
Why is the Holy Spirit so weak?

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.580
Guest: Go to Exodus 21.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.660
Justin: I told you, you're confusing Exodus 21 and Leviticus 25, I already got it, fantastic.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.800
This is going to cook you.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.560
Guest: No it isn't.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.100
Justin: Yeah, you're not going to like this at all.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.120
It says, when you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall go out, I'm sorry, he shall serve

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.600
you six years but in the seventh year he shall go out a free person without debt.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.560
Now, what if you're a woman though?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.500
Uh-huh.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.120
Have you read verse 7?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.880
When a man sells his daughter as a slave, yeah, she doesn't get to go out.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.980
And what happens if somebody is given a wife while they're in their six years of service?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.820
If a master gives them a wife and she bears some sons or daughters, the wife and her

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.220
children shall be her masters and he shall go out alone because they are permanent slaves.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.240
Guest: Okay, now go to verse 10, read verse 10.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.120
Justin: If he takes another wife to himself, so now we've got polygamy, if he takes another wife

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.400
to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.620
Yeah, if he takes a wife, because you're allowed to take multiple wives.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.500
Guest: So if you, if, I'm going to repeat that again, it says if he takes another wife, so if he

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.560
takes another wife, he shall not diminish food, clothing, and uh, right, yeah, right?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.980
Of who?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.800
Which is implying of the woman that was sold.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.340
No.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.120
Justin: Which means the woman.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.780
Wrong.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.040
Wrong.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.640
Yes, that's what it says.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.020
Guest: How's it wrong?

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.580
Justin: That, you're not to diminish the woman's sustenance while she is a concubine.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.620
Just like everything else, you haven't actually read the text, we'll read it for you.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.960
When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.720
If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.240
let her be redeemed.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.940
Why does it say that he has designated her for himself?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.390
Why does it say that he doesn't answer my question?

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.370
Why does it say that he designated this woman?

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.250
What's it mean when it says that she's been designated?

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.850
Guest: If you go back to the old Hebrew text, it says serve.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.110
Justin: What's it mean, Deuteronomy is not the old Hebrew text, Exodus is older.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.310
Guest: I'm talking about Exodus, I'm talking about the verse we're talking about.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.970
Justin: I know, we're in Exodus, I'm asking you a question about the passage in Exodus that

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.210
we literally just read.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.370
It says that if he designates her for himself or for the son, what does it mean to designate?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.410
Guest: In the old Hebrew text of that verse, it says serve.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.370
Justin: Stop saying Hebrew, you don't know Hebrew.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.990
Guest: Well, if you go to blueletterbible.org, it translates it for you.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.190
Justin: I actually know Hebrew, we're going to get into this.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:54.330
Okay, so Solo says, oh jeez, if I worship this god, if I worshiped a god this bad, I'd

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:54.910
stop voting.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.910
Big W Solo, I appreciate that, and I agree, I hope this guy doesn't vote.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:05.530
All right, so the problem here is that you're interpreting the word evid or ama to mean

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:05.930
what?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.810
Guest: Excuse me, sir, you got a…

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.510
Justin: Which word?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.630
Evid or ama?

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.650
Guest: Search it up in the blue letter at Bible.org, it tells you itself.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.430
Justin: I'm literally telling you what the words are.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.990
A male Hebrew slave is an evid.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.570
So what's your complaint with the Hebrew?

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.170
Guest: The lettering was changed.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.330
What lettering?

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.150
To serve.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.730
Justin: No, incorrect.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.290
Guest: Search it up, you can pull it up on your screen right now.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.630
Justin: And this guy is just a glutton for punishment.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:50.270
All right, we're going to do Exodus 21, and we'll do, which verse do you want to read?

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.900
Guest: You go to 1 Timothy 1.10.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.860
Justin: That's in Greek, it's not even the same book.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.320
We're talking about what's happening in Exodus 21.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.140
Guest: So you just want to talk about Old Testament, not New Testament?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080
Justin: So you're just dodging the passage.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.840
You're right, if I was in this conversation and I was in your position, I would buy a

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.240
ticket to get the fuck out of here real fast, because you're getting absolutely roasted

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.580
right now.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.760
This is embarrassing.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.820
So we're talking about what Exodus 21 says, and you're trying to run away from it now.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.820
So I want to know what in Exodus 21 gets is getting translated incorrectly.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.820
Guest: Well, you're misreading it, so.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.500
Justin: What am I misreading?

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.580
Guest: Do you keep interrupting me?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.120
Can I go?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.820
Justin: I asked you, you said I'm misreading.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.040
I want to give me the actual text that I'm misreading.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.840
Guest: Okay, I'm giving you verses and you keep saying I'm jumping around.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.640
These verses answer themselves.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.600
Justin: They don't.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.540
Guest: They do.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.840
Well, back then in the Bible, it states if you were in debt and you didn't have the money

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.960
to pay for it, you became a servant, which was called a slave in those days, and you

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.680
worked for free.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.300
Justin: I'll help you out.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.620
Do you see this?

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:58.880
Yes or no?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.580
You're wrong.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.820
I'm fixing it for you.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.180
Do you see this word right here?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.520
Right.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.200
That's a radicalized consonant at the end.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.740
This means, sorry, hold on, there we go.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.940
That's actually not the right one.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.220
Sorry.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.240
We want this word.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.160
There we go.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:15.520
Evin.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.660
This means a slave or a servant, right?

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.560
We also have the word ama in here somewhere in verse seven.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.120
If we go to verse seven, we'll find a different word for a female slave.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.340
Guest: But it says a servant right there.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.800
Justin: I know.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.760
I'm about to help you out.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.660
Just hold on tight.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.480
Okay, so we have another word that we find here.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.120
This is an ish for a male and a daughter, which is a bat, or if it's plural, it's going

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.800
to be different.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.920
There we go.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
And this is ama.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.700
So this root here means a female slave.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.480
This is a preposition.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.580
That's not part of the word.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.140
Okay, so these are the words that we have.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.140
And both of these words can mean a servant or a slave.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.020
Do you know what the difference between a servant and a slave is?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.180
Guest: Well, a slave doesn't get paid.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.440
And what else?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.880
Well, they get treated poorly.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.980
Justin: No, one goes free and one doesn't go free.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.420
Guest: Well, yes.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.120
What I'm trying to say-

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.600
Justin: Fantastic.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.660
In verse seven, do the female slaves get to go free?

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.530
Guest: If you go back to what it says-

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.750
Justin: In verse seven, do they get to go free?

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.430
It's a yes or no question.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.230
Guest: It doesn't say if they get to go free.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.850
Justin: It says the opposite.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.510
It says they don't get to go free.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:44.350
If you go to verse four about the woman who is given as a wife to the temporary servant,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.150
do they get to go free?

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.230
Guest: Well, yeah.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:49.910
Justin: No.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:54.330
It says if a master gives him a wife and she bears some sons or daughters, the wife and

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.110
her children shall be her masters and he shall go out alone.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.830
So they don't get to go free.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.550
That's called slavery.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.110
Imagine to have this much confidence to get up here and alive thinking you're going to

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.410
educate somebody and floundering in literally just three inches of water.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.590
You're literally drowning in a bathtub that just got turned on.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.830
We're not even deep yet.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:30.040
Guest: It says right here, but if the servant declares, I love my master and my wife and my children

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.920
and do not want to go free, then his master must take him before the judges.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:35.840
Justin: Yeah.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.000
And pierce his ear.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.520
I know.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.040
And why would he do that?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.240
Why would he make that decision?

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.960
Guest: Well, that's if he wants to keep them.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.680
Justin: Yes, because he doesn't want to get his family split up.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.180
Yes, because these people are permanent slaves.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.120
They are permanent slaves owned by the Hebrews.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.580
And if somebody gives you a slave and they bear children to you, your only option, your

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.080
only option is to become a slave yourself.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.900
You don't get to keep them.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.120
Guest: You're misreading that again.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.560
Israelites were enslaved for 400 years.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720
Justin: No, this is after.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.200
This is after.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.640
Guest: Yeah, this is exactly.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.620
So God's telling them, you guys are, yeah, I give you my right to own slaves for six

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.260
years and then you can free them the seventh year.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.300
Justin: Except for the women, it says, if his master gives him a wife and she she bears him sons

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:32.320
or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her masters and he will go out alone.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.860
The man is leaving alone.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.760
The man's wife and the children remain property of the master.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.420
Guest: Yes.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.860
I just said that God gave them the right to own slaves.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.220
I know.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.040
After they were enslaved.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.080
Justin: I know.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.020
Fantastic.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.240
We finally got it.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.680
Yes.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.060
God said you could own slaves.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.400
That's what background says.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.320
The Christian God condones slavery.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.460
I'm glad we can finally come to an agreement on that.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.060
Guest: You're misreading it again.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.020
Justin: OK.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:06.800
What did I misread?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.620
Guest: You're putting it.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.060
Well, you're putting it into text like he he thought it was OK for to own slaves out

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.660
of the random.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.640
He said you can do it.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.080
He.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.760
After they were enslaved for four hundred and thirty years, he said, you can do it.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.700
Justin: You can own slaves.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.540
He just doesn't want them to be enslaved by another nation.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.210
Guest: Well, they were enslaved for four hundred and thirty years.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:29.850
Correct or not?

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.150
Justin: Yes.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.630
And then God say and then God saved those people.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.770
Did he free all the slaves on the planet?

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.510
Guest: Oh, no, obviously not.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.070
Justin: Oh, OK.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.170
Who did he free?

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.390
Guest: The Israelites.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.110
Justin: Did he free the slaves owned by the Israelites?

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.450
Guest: Well, the men, yes, but the woman.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:50.870
Justin: Wrong.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:51.970
No, no.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.430
When they left, when they left Egypt, they already did.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.630
You know that when they left Egypt, they they're some of them own slaves.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.150
Guest: Well, yes.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:01.730
Justin: OK.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.850
Did God tell them to free the slaves?

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.520
Guest: It doesn't say the quote.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.980
Justin: OK, so God says you can own slaves.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.880
He tells you who you can own as slaves.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.280
He says you can beat your slave.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.120
Never once did he say that you can't own slaves.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.870
Guest: OK, and then go to Deuteronomy 11 to 14.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.730
Justin: I love Deuteronomy 11.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.290
I love Deuteronomy 11.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.650
It's one of my favorite chapters.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.430
Guest: 15 to chapter 15 verses 11 to 14.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.810
Justin: Oh, you're not going to like this at all.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.150
I love how they get up here thinking I haven't read it.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:36.710
All right.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.770
Deuteronomy chapter 15 11.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:44.030
Since there will never cease to be some in need on the earth, I therefore command you

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.530
open your hand to the poor and needy neighbor in your land.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.450
Say slave.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.650
Guest: Now, read verse three.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.900
Justin: Of a foreigner you may exact it, but you must remit your claim on whatever any member of

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.780
your community owes you.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.020
This is talking about lending an interest in collecting debts.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.940
So in the book of Deuteronomy and in the book of Exodus, we have laws about what kind of

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.880
debt and what kind of interest you can charge.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.560
And as it turns out, you can lend money at an interest to foreigners, but you couldn't

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.960
do it to your own fellow Hebrew Israelites because God has separate laws for what you

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.200
can do to your brothers and separate laws to what you can do to the foreigners.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.320
You can charge interest to the foreigners.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.920
You can go to war and kidnap the foreigners.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.080
You can enslave the foreigners.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.020
You just can't do it to your own fellow Hebrews unless they're women, because women are just

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.960
as bad as foreigners.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.420
Guest: It's telling you to cancel the debt.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.200
Justin: It doesn't say that.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:55.120
That's if they're your own fellow Hebrew and it's in the year of Jubilee.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.520
Have you never read the book?

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.980
What garbage website are you pulling these talking points from?

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.120
Because they're all garbage talking points.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.180
Guest: How are they garbage?

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.620
Justin: Because none of them land.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.680
None of them land.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.280
Do you know what the year of Jubilee is?

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.520
Guest: Yes, but no.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:23.220
Justin: Okay, what happens in the year of Jubilee?

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.460
Guest: I disfruited, no.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.300
Justin: What happens during the Jubilee?

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.220
Guest: Did I not disprove your point?

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:29.740
Justin: You didn't.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.460
You're cooking yourself.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.760
What happens during the Jubilee?

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.150
Guest: Because you said God said okay to all his slaves.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.010
Justin: What happens during the Jubilee?

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.190
Guest: Don't get out of topic.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.720
Justin: I'm responding to the verse you brought up, Nitwit.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.710
During the year of Jubilee, what happens?

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.100
Guest: And I'm not talking about that.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.740
Justin: I'm talking about your-

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.300
You are.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.240
Guest: You brought it up.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.040
Statement.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.100
Justin: All right, I'll break it down since you're not smart enough to gather it.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.160
It says every seventh year, you shall grant remission of debts.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.500
And these are debts to the Hebrews, not to the foreigners.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.380
And this is the manner of remission.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.340
Every creditor shall remit the claim that is held against a neighbor,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.400
not exacting it because the Lord's remission has been proclaimed.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.100
Of a foreigner, you may exact it.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.000
You do not remit the debt of a foreigner.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.030
You keep cooking yourself over and over again.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.770
You must be a sadomasochist.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.750
Guest: Your original claim was that it was okay for God to own slaves.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.130
God said you can do it.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.910
He said it to the Israelites after they were enslaved for 430 years.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.210
Justin: God said you can do it.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:49.670
I know.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.270
We keep going back to this.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.750
Guest: Okay, so I did refute your claim.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.330
Justin: When God says you can do it, it means you can do it.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.250
Guest: Well, he said under one condition.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.950
If you were enslaved and you were an Israelite, which is the context,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.750
you can own a slave up to six years and free them to seven.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.230
Justin: Wrong.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.090
We'll read it again.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.150
We'll try this again.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.350
The condition is that if they're a foreigner, they can be your property for life.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.790
It says you may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.890
and from their families who have been, I'm sorry,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.690
family who are with you have been born in your land.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.630
They may be your property.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.830
You may keep them as a possession for your children after you,

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.210
for them to inherit as property.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.290
In the Hebrew, it actually says le'olam, which means forever,

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:35.110
which is why a lot of translations say that they will be your property forever

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.050
or they will say they'll be your permanent property.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.650
And he ran.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.050
I didn't cut him, guys.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.970
He cooked.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:50.090
Imagine coming in with that amount of gusto, having not read any of it,

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.730
literally just Googling talking points, trying to find anything that would land.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.790
These people are embarrassing.
