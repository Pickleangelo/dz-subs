WEBVTT

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:16.220
All right, okay, we're gonna see if this works now.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.020
We're gonna try to, one second,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.480
make sure all the audio works.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.380
So I switched everything over to OBS,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.000
and right now I'm running everything through OBS

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.400
rather than Streamlabs.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.200
I suspect Streamlabs might actually be the issue,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.260
not YouTube.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.020
Certainly doesn't seem to be my hardware.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.460
So we've got everything switched over to OBS now.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.880
We'll see if this works any better.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.100
What a disaster.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.460
What a disaster technology it turned out to be today.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.260
All right, so it looks like the vertical stream is good.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600
Vertical stream is not lagging right now.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.420
I'm gonna switch real quick over to the horizontal stream,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.700
make sure horizontal stream is rocking and rolling.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.520
Horizontal stream should be started.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.740
Give me a second.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.700
Yep, horizontal stream's running.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.600
Okay, both streams are running.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.220
Fantastic, that's what we needed to hear.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.740
Okay, so I'll keep track of it then from here,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.080
and we should be good to go.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm so sorry, friends, for the technology hiccups today.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.820
I don't know why it's behaving like this.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.820
It's ridiculous.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.460
But I suspect this should fix the problem.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.420
So I think Streamlabs server is having a bad day.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.640
The reason why I use Streamlabs rather than OBS typically

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.180
is because I stream to five different places at once,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.500
and every time you open up a new stream,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.240
it takes that much bandwidth from your computer

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.520
and from your home network.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.120
However, if you stream to Streamlabs,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.660
what happens is it sends one stream over to Streamlabs,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.800
and then Streamlabs server will send it out

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.380
to all the various destinations.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.300
So it frees up a lot of bandwidth at home,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.300
which is really nice.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.800
It's like a super convenient tool.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.420
But as we're seeing today,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020
it might only be convenient when it works.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.520
It might not always work.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.060
I think this might be, if I'm seeing this correctly,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.240
if it really is an issue on Streamlabs side of things,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.560
this might actually be the first time

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.660
I've ever had a problem with the Streamlabs server.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.580
It's really weird.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.460
They must be having some sort of a situation today.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.360
Probably one of those attacks.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.140
So that somebody sent something to the server,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.460
they opened up the wrong email,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.760
and now they got a virus.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.500
What are you gonna do?

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.700
What are you gonna do?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.940
Hey, listen, our friend GenX Christian's now

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.080
a member of the Kraken Crew Elite.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.560
Thank you so much, GenX Christian.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.280
I really appreciate that.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.880
That's a super kind button.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.460
Okay, so I got the chat windows open.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.460
We're ready to rock and roll.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.660
We're gonna do everything we can.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.680
We are live now.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.900
I apologize for the hiccups that we had.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.280
I think they might not be watchable

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.840
because the livestream was so choppy prior.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.560
I don't know if any of the answers

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.360
from the previous two streams are watchable,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.120
so I apologize for that.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.600
We've got Mr. Mackie with us, though.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.140
Hell yeah, Mr. Mackie.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.940
Oh, hold on.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.840
I gotta adjust my green screen.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.060
One second.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.400
All right.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.440
You can see you're missing the background

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.820
on the super chat.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.400
One second, I apologize.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.980
I apologize.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.780
I had to do quite a bit of stuff on the last...

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.720
There we go.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.720
There we go.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.340
That's pretty good.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.820
Now you should be able to read it.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.020
Yeah, your internet needs more cowbell.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.700
Indeed, it does.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.120
Actually, I've got a great internet set up right now.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.680
I'm actually streaming on fiber.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.920
I've got all kinds of internet to work with.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.180
My bandwidth is really good.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.320
If I get into a situation where my bandwidth

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.740
is not meeting expectations,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.520
then it's gotta be on the YouTube server

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.160
or the Streamlab server.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.480
And that seems to be the case

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.680
because right now we're using OBS,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.240
which means 100% of the bandwidth is on my side now.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.380
It's using my hardware.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.200
And it seems like we're okay.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.800
So that being the case,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.060
I think we're good to go.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.700
I apologize that Streamlabs is doing what Streamlabs do.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.020
But what are you gonna do, you know?

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.200
Sorry about that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.440
SFP says, why are there no humans living in the ocean?

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.200
It's because Jesus has been coming for 2000 years straight

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.580
and he ran out of this.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.500
That's why the ocean is so salty, obviously.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.960
I mean, we could just put two together.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.960
He ran out of semen because it filled the ocean.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.240
That's why the ocean is salty.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.960
Yeah, really something.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.840
Could you imagine being like,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.920
I'm almost coming back.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.700
I'm almost coming.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.540
I'm almost coming.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.420
And then 2000 years later,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.220
what an unfulfilling session, Jesus.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.680
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.540
And Carnage, great to see you, friend.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.240
Carnage says, here's for a better internet connection.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.100
My resolution this year is to help the needy.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.520
Well, thank you, Carnage.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.920
I appreciate that.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.960
I appreciate that, Carnage.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.140
Well, I don't know if I count as needy.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.340
I could be wrong.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.400
I think I'm getting by with the power of Doug.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.140
But I appreciate all the support for the channel.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.140
I really do.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.660
All the support for the channel

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.340
is greatly appreciated, friends.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.060
And our friend David.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.840
Welcome to see you, David.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.820
Thanks for stopping in.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.060
Thank you for the $20 Super Chat says,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.760
is God circumcised?

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.080
Was Jesus at birth?

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.160
Was Jesus at birth if God knew it was necessary?

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.960
So Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.160
according to custom.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.600
We read this, that's why they went to Jerusalem

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.800
according to the Gospels.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.740
So it seems like he wasn't born circumcised.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.520
Now, whether or not God is circumcised,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.420
I assume not because Paul states

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.780
that Jesus is the visible image of the invisible God,

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.420
which means theoretically to Paul,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.820
Paul thinks that God is, the Father is immaterial.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.800
And at best case, he doesn't have a peen.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.080
So if God doesn't have a peen,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.820
then it seems like he's not circumcised.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.920
But that would betray the Old Testament

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.780
because in the Old Testament, God smells, God hears,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.220
he sees, he has all the senses

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.880
that a human being would have.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.000
He even has hands, he has a face.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.100
As far as we can tell,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.320
the God of the Old Testament does have a body.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.740
And if he does have a body, then he would have a peen.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.840
Now, whether or not he's circumcised is a different story

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.900
because my theory is that circumcision

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.120
originally developed as a habit

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.240
for what they thought as cleanliness

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.080
because they didn't bathe like we bathed.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.840
And so they would get infections.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.300
So I think they took after the Egyptians

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.780
and circumcised themselves

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.520
rather than bathing regularly enough to avoid infections.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.880
And then they had to explain it

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.740
by saying, oh, fuck, God told us to.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.620
And if that's the case,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.520
if circumcision originated to deal with infection,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.720
then it seems to me that God wouldn't need to be circumcised

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.160
because I don't think he gets penile infections in heaven.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.500
That, I mean, this seems to be the case.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.960
I could be wrong,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.020
but that's how I'm reading the situation.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.060
And as Sharer says, what's your MBTI type?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.700
I think it's ENFJ.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.180
I haven't taken it in a long time.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.100
But what I can tell you, I forget my letter designation.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.240
What I can tell you is that every time I've taken it,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.520
I get the same thing as every other engineer.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.300
All the engineers end up with the same personality profile

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.280
for the Myers-Briggs.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.960
So if you just Google the typical engineer

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.440
Myers-Briggs type inventory,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.840
you'll end up with me.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.640
So I forget what it is though, I apologize.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.700
But yeah, I think my personality is pretty easy to peg.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.620
So there's that.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.660
Good question though.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.020
Dustin says, good morning, Justin.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.300
So one of my favorite talking points

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.900
is the very obvious inspiration

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.860
of the Old Testament authors

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.520
pulled from the surrounding cultures,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.660
i.e. flood, narrative, tower, babble, et cetera.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.500
What do you, do you have a favorite?

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.390
First of all, the talking point that you like is true.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.690
The Old Testament authors did pull

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.870
from the Babylonian literature.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.590
In fact, the first 11 chapters of the Book of Genesis,

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.050
everything in there, every last story,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.450
there's a parallel in the Babylonian literature.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.910
So it's just obvious.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.390
They pulled from Babylonian literature.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.370
Now the problem is it's hard to prove that to a Christian.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.770
So, and it takes a lot of time.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.250
So I don't use that argument too often during the debates,

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.230
but I 100% agree with you.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.890
It was one of the things

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.210
that really catapulted my deconstruction

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.550
was realizing that these stories weren't authentic

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.050
and they weren't even native to just the Bible,

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.870
they were robbed.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.690
So if that's the case,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.150
and the New Testament treats them

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.770
like their legitimate history,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.990
well, then the New Testament is not true.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.490
That's what that means.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.610
But my favorite talking point,

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.570
and people who know my channel know this,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.670
my favorite talking point ever,

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.730
and I would talk about it every single day,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.310
my favorite talking point is in fact

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.050
that Jesus did not fulfill any messianic prophecies,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.750
not even one, not even close to one.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.330
And so for me, that's all I need to know

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.810
to know that Christianity is not true.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.910
Now, if you want to debunk the entire Bible

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.490
and you're like, listen,

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.110
it's not good enough just to debunk Christianity,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.990
we need to debunk the Old Testament too.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.430
If that's the case,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.050
if you really want to debunk the Old Testament,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.690
I would go in and show all the unscientific stuff in there,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.210
the firmament, the flat earth,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.530
the bad geological record from the flood,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.330
how the animals certainly couldn't have

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.390
repopulated the earth with what they started from,

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.110
how the flood story doesn't make any sense

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.890
because there's no way to get food on the ark

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.330
for all the carnivorous animals

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.110
and still have space for them,

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.810
or how you couldn't collect any food for the koala bears

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.210
because they have such a specific diet.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.190
And the panda bears,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.670
where are you getting all the bamboo from for 371 days?

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.710
Whereas these narratives, they're simply fictitious.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.750
They can't be true, right?

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.050
And so that's a good way of getting at the Old Testament.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.370
Also, thank you for sending out

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.550
five deconstruction zone memberships, Johanna.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.730
It's great to see you, friend.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.710
Welcome to the stream.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.010
And Brittany says, if Paul thought Jesus died for our sins

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.510
and the old laws passed away,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.350
why did he go to the temple for purification

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.930
and sacrificial offerings in Acts?

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.250
My reading of Paul is this.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.610
I don't think Paul knows right away what to do.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.080
I don't think he knew right away what the situation was.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.180
When I'm reading Paul, I'm seeing a Paul

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.200
that is trying to figure it out as he goes.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.760
And so I don't know if Paul knew right away

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.960
what the situation was.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.800
That being said,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.320
I don't know if he participated

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.340
in the sacrificial offerings.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.340
I can't think of the section in Acts.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.080
In the festival, in Acts 21,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.520
I think is what you're referring to.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.760
Let's grab Acts 21 and take a look at this.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.440
We don't get to read Acts 21 very often.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.160
In Acts 21, you're almost near the point

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.440
where it seems like he's getting close

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.180
to being in custody, but let's get Acts 21 open.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.680
So he's giving some of the voyage

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.280
and this is some of the famous we passages,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.440
which are a lot of fun.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.800
So in the famous we passages,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.320
it says, when our days there were ended,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.140
we left and proceeded on our journey

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.360
and all of them with wives and children

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.740
escorted us outside the city.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.780
We're there.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.860
We know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.600
Did I read?

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.120
Where is it?

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.520
That was Acts 21, six.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.000
What was, what I missed?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.260
What I missed, what I missed?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.340
I grabbed the wrong verse.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.060
I do fat finger the verse when I typed it in.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.760
All right, give me one second.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.520
I apologize.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.320
What verse was I looking for?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.240
Oh, I'm a dummy.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.480
It's Acts 21, 26.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.520
Acts 21, 26, cool.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.260
Okay, this is Paul's visit to James in Jerusalem

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.300
and then while they're in Jerusalem,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.400
says, but as for the Gentiles who have become believers,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.600
we have sent a letter with our judgment

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.040
that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.360
to idols and from blood

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.960
and from what is strangled and sexual impurity.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.800
Yes, this is Acts chapter 15 where this is explained.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.580
Then Paul took them in and the next day,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.100
having purified himself,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.980
he entered the temple with them,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.000
making public completion of the days of purification

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.500
when the sacrifice would be made for each of them.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.360
That is actually interesting.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.320
Because he didn't have to.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.420
That's something I haven't thought about before.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.120
This is actually a really interesting question.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.180
I can't believe it's never come up before

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.700
because certainly here, there's no requirement, right?

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.000
Jesus is already dead.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.740
There's no requirement to do the purification.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.990
I'm curious if there was others with them

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.810
that were like, no, no, you got to.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.430
You gotta follow the customs.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.070
You gotta follow the customs, Paul.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.930
But there's obviously more men there.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.510
Paul took the men and the next day purified himself.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.070
So there's multiple people there.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.710
And then, of course, you've got the arrest

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.390
coming up right here.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.890
Wow, what an interesting,

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.550
I don't know what to make of that just yet.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.970
You'll have to let me look into that.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.410
That's a really good question.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.090
Shit.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.010
What the hell was he doing there?

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.870
He shouldn't have been there.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.010
According to Paulian theology,

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.650
let's just say the thing that needs to be said first,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.370
which is that he certainly didn't need to be there

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.970
to doing any purification acts.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.150
If he was doing any rites of purification,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.130
it had to be completely voluntary,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.010
at least in Paul's point of view.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.610
That's actually a really good question.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.870
I'm gonna think on that when we get,

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.330
maybe our next question in here,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.010
I'm gonna think on a possible answer for that though.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.950
That's a good question.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.510
Johanna says, God may have a hoodie,

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.190
maybe he doesn't,

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.890
but he sure likes collecting them.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.590
What if the reason why God collects so-called hoodies

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.770
is because he doesn't have one and he's jealous?

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.230
If I can't have one, nobody can.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.730
That's what's happening with the foreskin situation.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.270
God's like, if I can't have a fucking foreskin,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.850
nobody gets one.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.230
And if you keep yours, you're in big fucking trouble.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.030
Actually, I think that's a believable concept.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.490
I'm done with that one.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.650
I'm done with that one.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.210
I'm gonna ask, I'm gonna see if the internet has the

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:33.770
answers.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:41.760
I'm gonna say, why did Paul follow purification rites

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.620
in Acts 21?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.020
Surely somebody has an interesting answer to this.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.380
Yeah, I mean, everyone's just saying

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.500
it's out of respect.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.820
Yeah, is it due to respect for the Jewish customs?

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.680
Yeah, we know.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.300
We know, but why?

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.480
Why does he care?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.680
Because he tells everyone not to do that.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.820
He specifically says not to do it.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.100
Maybe the real answer is that Paul's just a hypocrite.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.060
You know what I mean?

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.920
I don't see any good answers on the usual places.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.100
I'll hit around for this.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.520
Now I wanna know the answer too.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.120
I don't know if there's a good answer

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.420
other than Paul's a hypocrite, which we've seen elsewhere,

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.900
where he tells you not to follow the law.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.140
The law has been abolished.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.340
That's Ephesians chapter two says

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.700
that it's been completely abolished.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.720
But then he goes on later to say,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.700
well, if you don't follow these certain laws,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.600
you'll go to hell.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.700
Like he talks through both sides of his mouth

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.540
all the time.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.420
This might be one of those cases.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.600
Drew says, why couldn't God defeat chariots of iron?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.520
Am I safe from God while I'm in my chair?

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.620
And referring to judges, there's a passage in Judges.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.380
Was it chapter two?

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.160
The chariots of iron, I think it's like 211 maybe,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.320
if I remember correctly.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.660
So there's a passage in Judges two

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:13.480
where Yahweh goes to battle with the Judeans.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.620
And it couldn't defeat them

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.240
because they had chariots of iron.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.600
Let me grab it, it might be Judges one.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.960
I apologize, probably Judges one.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.560
All right.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.300
Oh shit, I'm in Joshua.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.020
I want Judges, there we go.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.260
And now we're in Judges.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.020
Yeah, Judges 119, I was off by a bit there.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.680
Let me grab Judges 119

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.960
because it's such a funny thing that this even happens.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:57.160
Judges 119, shit, Drew's super chat is open.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.560
Okay, let me take care of that.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.460
It says, we're gonna get there.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.360
The Lord was with Judah.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.820
Okay, so they're in battle.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.940
And the Lord was with Judah, obviously,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.680
because that's the strength of the people, right?

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.160
The Lord was with Judah

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.060
and he took possession of the hill country

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.180
but could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.040
because they had chariots of iron.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.900
Now, obviously, there's been a lot of hubbub made

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.220
about the fact that it says he rather than they.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.400
And people will say, because it says he,

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.860
it must be referring to Yahweh and not to the people.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:41.780
But the people in Hebrew would be ha'am,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.280
would be like a collective.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.940
Like it's technically singular,

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.120
but it's used as a collective.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.040
Or sometimes it's a collective used as a singular.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.660
So when it talks about he,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.680
he would mean the people of Judah, right?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.120
Or just Judah proper.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.520
So you don't have to interpret he

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.120
as a singular entity like Yahweh.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.140
It could actually be referring to the people.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.200
Now, here's why that doesn't matter though.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.400
None of that's actually relevant.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.780
Whether or not the he is referring to the Lord or to Judah,

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.640
it doesn't matter because if the Lord was with Judah,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.960
meaning that's why they're winning the war

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.640
because the Lord is with them,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.920
that means he's still ultimately responsible

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.500
for the failure of not being able

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.000
to drive out the chariots of iron.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.460
And this is not the first time God couldn't do something.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.400
Think of Mark chapter six, verse five and six,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.260
where Jesus couldn't heal people

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.900
because of their lack of faith.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.620
And we, of course, second kings,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.340
or first kings, chapter two,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.400
I always forget if first or second kings,

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.480
I'm gonna say second kings two,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.110
where there's a war with Moab

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.790
and they get fucked up by Moab

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.530
because the king of Moab sacrifices his son

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.570
in the middle of the losing battle.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.770
So God does in fact lose.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.270
Like there are things he can't do in the Bible

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.210
and in the Hebrew Bible.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.090
Was it second kings three?

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.610
Let me try this again.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.390
My memory's off today, I need more sleep.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.900
Yeah, second kings, chapter three

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.840
is when they lose the war to the Moabites.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.500
The prophet Jehoshaphat,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.320
or the prophets alongside Jehoshaphat

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.820
literally said that they're gonna win the war.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.820
God will deliver them into your hands.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.560
And then what happens is the opposite of that.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.360
It says that he took his firstborn, King Masha,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.620
his firstborn son who would succeed him

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.460
and offer him as a burnt offering on the wall

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.160
and great wrath came upon Israel

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.780
so they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.720
So God just can't do some shit in the Bible.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.140
And those are two cases

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.340
where God clearly can't do things.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.000
It's pretty crazy to think about actually.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.460
Let me grab the next one, great question.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.660
Roger says, hi from a creepy EE, but not a bad coder.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.960
What was a crappy EE about it?

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.800
Well, listen, you'd be surprised

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.460
at how many electrical engineers

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.860
spent their career coding

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.440
rather than doing electrical engineering work

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.440
and how many coders I've met

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.520
that did like a computer science degree

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.300
that ended up doing electrical engineering.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.080
There's a lot of crossover.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.960
Now, one thing I've seen lately

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.480
in like the last 10 years

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.840
is in the field of controls

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.620
and the field of automation,

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.040
they're hiring a lot more people

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.620
with computer science

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.480
or computer engineering backgrounds

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.240
than they are electrical engineers

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.680
because they can do the same thing

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.600
as control engineers can do typically.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600
They can do electrical drawings.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.380
And then on top of it,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.540
they're really good at coding.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.020
And almost all electrical engineers today

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.380
have to be able to do coding.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.680
So welcome.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.520
Edward says, have you considered,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.200
W is not W.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.780
I haven't considered that.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.240
Words are not words.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.260
I do appreciate the formulation.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.620
That's actually a really good one.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.420
We should do to shorten down that slogan.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.080
We can do words don't mean words

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.440
in that particular format.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.980
And I love this format.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.800
We'll make this a reality.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.920
This is a good idea.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.300
And Johanna says, quick question.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.680
How do I change my credit card?

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.400
Oh, I don't know.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.120
I have no idea actually.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.040
I assume you mean within YouTube.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.020
Like you have to give it

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.900
your credit card information

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.380
when you sign up to send super chats.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.160
And that I don't know.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.920
When I first started sending super chats,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.940
it asked me for my payment information

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.960
and I entered it

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.260
and I don't know where it went to.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.680
It's in the ether now.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.840
The ether owns it.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.600
YouTube owns it.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.020
I don't know how to change it, my friend.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.320
Marcus, thank you for the question.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.060
Says, what is the specific arguments

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.340
you've heard from apologists

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.760
that make sense of the detailed instructions

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.940
of animal sacrifice in Ezekiel's vision

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.920
of the Messianic temple?

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.580
Well, first of all,

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.480
I've only heard one person attempt to address it.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.940
Most theists don't know it's there.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.700
Most Christians don't know it's even there.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.380
They have no idea what to do with it.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.220
That being said, the ones that are aware of it

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.300
had tried to say,

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.200
well, when Jesus comes back,

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.180
the sacrificial system and the land and everything

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.280
is gonna be restored

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.300
and then we're gonna do the sacrifices and offerings.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.880
Therefore, Ezekiel's not lying.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.160
It's gonna happen when he comes back.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.320
But this is stupid.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.020
This is a stupid apologetic

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.940
because the entirety of the New Testament

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.440
teaches that Jesus was the final sacrifice.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.060
That's it.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.700
We don't need any of these sin sacrifices

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.760
from Ezekiel 45.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.700
We don't need them.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.420
Jesus was the last one,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.120
once and for all, one and done.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.180
So that, as for an argument against Ezekiel,

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.420
I've never heard a good one.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.740
I've heard arguments.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.440
I've never heard a good argument.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.980
The reality is Christians aren't reading the Old Testament.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.380
They're sure as hell not reading Ezekiel.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.380
Doc Pluroma, thank you for the question.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.400
Also, friends, I can't stream late today.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.400
So I've already got a bunch of questions in the queue.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.340
So I'm gonna end it here in like a half hour

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.900
or 45 minutes,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.260
because I'm taking my son to the beach.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.540
We're gonna go have a lot of fun.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.360
So I'm gonna get through all the questions

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.340
that we have now.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.460
Unfortunately, we wasted a bunch of time

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.740
on non-working streams.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.260
Those streams are working with OBS.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.260
Maybe in the future, I'll just use OBS.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.360
Maybe I won't use Streamlabs anymore

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.360
if Streamlabs can't cooperate.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.600
But we got a question from Doc says,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.280
do you think Paul would be baffled or amused

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.860
by how much we obsess over his thorn in his side?

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.400
Maybe he just wanted a good excuse

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.420
to skip a few meetings.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.100
This is such a good point.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.420
So no one really knows

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.220
what the thorn in Paul's side is.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.040
But when he uttered those words,

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.280
did he believe that people would be wasting

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.380
valuable time trying to figure out

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.920
what the hell the thorn in the side was?

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.860
No way.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.700
No way he thought that.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.800
And the fact that people do,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.060
the fact that people literally obsess

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.380
over these super irrelevant topics,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.500
just shows you that the state of Christianity

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.800
is a crazy one, you know?

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.980
They don't want to go out and feed the poor.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.820
They don't want to go out and help the homeless.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.420
They don't want to do the stuff

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.720
that Jesus told them to do.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.500
They want to obsess over nonsense

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.160
and then have church divides

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.760
over whether or not a woman can speak in public

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.300
or whether or not you need to be dipped

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.800
going forward or backwards when you get baptism

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.300
or whether or not you can be sprinkled rather than dipped.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.140
They don't want to do any real stuff.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.680
Doug Brown says,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.200
Doug's namesake and prophet bids you all hello.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.760
Well, thank you so much, Doug.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.040
I appreciate that.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.840
Hail Doug and Doug Brown, both Dougs.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.960
And Booget says, in Matthew 26, 20,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.720
I'm sorry, Matthew 26, 6,

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.840
Jesus really saying, F the poor.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.500
That perfume and its dollar value

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.840
is better spent on me.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.760
Kind of shitty of him.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.080
So this is the funny thing, Matt,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.080
not Matt, Booget.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.900
I agree with you.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.740
Your interpretation of Matthew is correct.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.060
So Jesus is essentially saying

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.400
that paying him homage is more important

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.560
than the people that are literally

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.280
got children starving to death.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.560
Just imagine that for a second.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.820
Jesus could have sold the perfume,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.600
could have had somebody sold the perfume

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.440
and been like, here's some help.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.680
Now, here's the crazy thing.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.720
Remember, Jesus did magic, right?

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.960
People always forget this, but never forget this.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.960
Jesus did magic, which means when Jesus

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.420
was alive on earth, at least in Judea,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.840
nobody, nobody had to be poor.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.600
Nobody had to be homeless.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.180
Nobody had to be starving.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.740
He could just did magic and poof,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.960
all you have food now.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.480
He didn't do any of that.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.620
Imagine if you had magical powers,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.580
all the problems you would fix.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.260
The fact that the Bible, Jesus had all these powers

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.840
and he didn't fix shit, that tells you it's fiction.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.060
It's not a real story.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.760
It's a fantasy, friends.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.300
And Marcus, thank you for the additional question, says,

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.580
why theologically does Jesus tell Jews

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.800
during the Sermon on the Mount

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.840
after healing the leper to offer animal sacrifices

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.700
when he was the lamb of God

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.620
and was already forgiving sins while alive?

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.100
Such a good point.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.140
And Rabbi Tovia Singer brings this up as well,

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.360
which is when you read the book of Matthew,

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.500
the biggest Judaizer in the book of Matthew

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.780
is Jesus himself.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.960
Like there's a big deal made in theology

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.540
about Paul combating Judaizers.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.080
Like Paul is out there trying to battle

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.840
against the Judaizers.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.160
But reality is his biggest opponent was Jesus.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.840
Nobody was more Judaizing than Jesus himself.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.460
The dude did want you to follow the law.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.500
He told you to.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.040
He told you to follow the law

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.100
in Matthew chapter five, 17 through 19.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.760
And he does this.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.100
When the rich young ruler comes to him and says,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.980
what must I do to inherit eternal life?

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.620
He says to follow the commandments.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.940
When he heals the people,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.680
he tells them to go to the temple

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.520
and be ritually cleansed,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.340
which you have to do according to the Old Testament.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.800
If you had leprosy or some sort of skin rash

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.940
and it came and it was cleansed,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.020
or it disappeared, it went away.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.540
You still had to go get cleansed

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.060
and then have a waiting period

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.040
before you could be welcomed back into the community.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.900
So yeah, Jesus was a Judaizer.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.000
That's why he said to do this.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.420
The reality is Paul and Jesus do not agree.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.760
And Paul continually talking out both sides of his mouth

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.260
as we just actually talked about in Acts chapter 21

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.860
that somebody brought up, which is that Paul,

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.160
in Acts chapter 21, verse 26,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.720
went to the temple and participated

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120
in the purification rituals.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.040
So the New Testament does not have a cohesive,

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.660
absolutely does not have a cohesive viewpoint on the law.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.040
And Dustin says,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.680
one thing I've noticed watching your streams

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.340
is that when backed into a corner,

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.800
every theist argument eventually boils down

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.760
to a presupposition, whether they realize it or not.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.500
Have you noticed this?

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.300
It is, Dustin, it is.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.040
Every single, every single Christian argument

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.460
when you've knocked down their claims

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.560
about the flood nonsense, about prophecy nonsense,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.200
they always end up in a position where it's,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.720
well, I just presuppose it by faith.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.220
Well, you can't explain X therefore God.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.640
They always go back to a God of the gaps.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.260
And this is how you know

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.200
that they simply don't have any answers

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.660
because they have to fall back on God of the gaps.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.280
They have to fall back on it true

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.080
because they presuppose it to be true.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.220
And these aren't good ways to know truth.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.020
You can't know truth in this particular fashion.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.680
TV atheist says, I keep telling you OBS is pro level.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.980
OBS is good.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.100
In fact, when I first started doing streams,

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.860
I was only using OBS.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.980
The reason why I switched to Streamlabs

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.820
and I paid the money for Streamlabs

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.080
is to lower the actual amount of bandwidth

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.940
that I personally needed to use.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.220
So I could stream multiple streams to YouTube.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.260
I could stream to Facebook.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.600
I could stream to Twitch, so on and so forth.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.160
And then I could run TikTok Studio alongside of it

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.160
and not have lagging on TikTok Studio.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.220
So that's why I switched to Streamlabs.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.520
But now that I'm running fiber at home,

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.020
shit, maybe I'll just use OBS.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.900
It seems like I've got plenty of bandwidth

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.460
on my fiber network to open as many streams as I need.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.640
Oh, of course I could just not stream to Twitch.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.960
Nobody gives a shit about Twitch.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.120
No one's watching these debates on Twitch.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.780
So maybe it is time to switch to OBS.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.560
OBS does give me a lot more control

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.580
over some of the features as well.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.880
So I do like that.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.140
With Streamlabs, they limit some of the controls

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:16.960
you can have.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.360
And Nomad, thank you for the question, says,

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.220
can you speak a bit on the trial of bitter waters,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.320
numbers 511?

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.620
I brought this up in a discussion on abortion

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.420
with a Christian once, but I need more context.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.480
So this is really good.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.780
Actually, my friend Chet and I

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.240
are gonna be doing a session kind of on this topic

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.760
here in a bit.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.860
So the trial of bitter waters works like this.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.440
If the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.660
and he believes that his wife cheated on him,

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.380
now this is probably happening

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.160
because she's fucking pregnant

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.240
and he's like, I don't think I got her pregnant.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.680
How'd she get pregnant, right?

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.760
It's hard to know when the spirit of jealousy

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.260
could fall on somebody, right?

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.220
That being said, if that happens,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.940
what you need to do is take her to the priest.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.540
He'll make a potion of,

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.400
he'll write a curse on a scroll, scrape it off.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.660
The scrapings go into the potion.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.740
Some dirt from the floor go into the potion.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.360
She drinks this cursed potion.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.280
It's basically poison.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.580
And if it makes her really sick

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.120
and causes her womb to discharge,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.220
then it's presumed that she's guilty

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.880
and she won't be able to bear the children.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.860
If in fact she's innocent,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.280
the potion won't harm her

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.560
and she'll be able to bear children or conceive.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.200
So the reality is if he was accusing her,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.240
my goodness, I gotta get more sleep.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.740
If he was accusing her because she was pregnant

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.680
and he doesn't think it's his,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.220
then she would have a miscarriage or an abortion.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.120
That's why the newest iteration of the NIV

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.220
just says abortion.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.400
The pregnancy is gonna be terminated.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.060
So numbers five is indeed an abortion.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.320
Now, it's fun because it's very similar

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.020
to what's known as the river ordeal.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.820
In ancient Sumer and Babylon and Assyria,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.880
they believed that there were like river deities

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.500
that caused the rivers to rage and lower

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.660
and rage and lower.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.660
And so one of the ways you could test

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.200
the unfaithfulness of a spouse

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.780
is to throw them in the river.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.400
Like if you come and you got the spirit of jealousy,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.120
rather than making them take the magic poison,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.880
you could just take them to the judge

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.140
and throw their ass in a river.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.360
And depending on what happens in the river,

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.860
that determines whether or not they were guilty

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.120
because the river god will determine

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.760
whether or not they were innocent or guilty.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.720
So it's a really fun thing.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.620
We're gonna talk about that soon.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.080
I see more questions coming in, friends.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.420
I'm gonna answer all the questions

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.340
that we have on the board

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.780
and then I've got to end the stream.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.560
I'm sorry we wasted so much time

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.460
on getting the stream transferred over

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.660
to a working platform.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.600
It just was one of those days.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.700
But I've got hard plans today.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.440
I'm going to the beach with my son.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.360
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.700
So I can't stay late.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.760
I'm gonna answer these questions.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.800
I gotta scoot.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.460
Medioger, still love the name.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.840
Says, as a debate prompt,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.640
have you considered Abrahamic religions

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.940
are regurgitated Babylonian or whatever mythology

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.760
it seems like a great topic?

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.520
I agree.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.500
It is a great topic.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.100
And the reason why I don't have a topic like that

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.140
is because it really narrows down the conversation

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.740
and my streams are typically like five or six hours,

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.200
which means for five or six hours,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.360
the audience hears the same talking points

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.860
over and over and over again

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.580
because it's such a narrow topic.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.540
Now we could do it in like a multi-topic format

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.860
where we do a live stream

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.440
and like here are the multiple topics

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.520
we can talk about today.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.080
And that would make it a little easier

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.500
or I can preserve it.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.260
I can make a topic like this

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.020
for when I know I'm only gonna have

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.200
two or three hours to debate.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.860
Then we can definitely do that.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.340
But I do like the idea.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.200
It certainly is a good idea to do a topic

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.280
where like, you know,

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.080
the Old Testament is stolen from other literature.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.440
That'd be a lot of fun.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.180
Or you could say the Old Testament is stolen mythology.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.880
I would have a lot of fun with that.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.900
I did do a live stream like over a year ago

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.200
where I did that with this hell and Satan

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.420
where I did, hell and Satan are stolen mythologies.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.920
They're not native to the Bible.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.520
And that was a lot of fun.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.360
Nicholas says, do the Sanhedrin record Jesus

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.300
and can I read it?

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:33.240
Yes, Sanhedrin 43A records what we would call

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.840
the trial and the execution of Jesus de Nazarene.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.520
It says he was stoned and hugged up on a stick.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.080
It even talks a little bit about how

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.580
some of his disciples were killed.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.840
And it even talks about why he was killed

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.040
for sorcery and leading the people astray.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.320
And his mother even comes up.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.940
So I would read Sanhedrin 43A.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.120
And Dr. Pisa said, do people ever address the point,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.600
that the point of the flood was to cleanse the land of evil

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.440
but it didn't work.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.640
Any other incompetent God goofs.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.940
So I did this when I first started streaming to TikTok

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.000
before I was on YouTube, I used to run a topic

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.580
that was the flood of Noah was a failure.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.200
And I listed all the reasons why the flood of Noah

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.660
was an absolute failure.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.140
The reality is most Christians don't realize it.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.760
If the goal of the flood was to rid the planet

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.000
of the evil humans and of the Nephilim, neither came true.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.340
It says right after the flood that the intentions

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.400
of the heart of humans are evil even from youth.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.480
And then we learned that there's more Nephilim left over.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.580
Numbers chapter 13, Deuteronomy chapter two,

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.640
there's more Nephilim.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.120
They're still fucking around,

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.600
which means the flood didn't do a damn thing.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.800
Tarana says with Bible degrees,

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.300
what's the job career prospect?

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800
Not much.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.720
Either you're a pastor

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.400
or you're an independent media content creator,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.840
or you get a high level degree like a PhD and you teach.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.820
That's about it, you can't do much else.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.700
That's like saying, I got a law degree,

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.740
but I don't wanna practice law, what can I do?

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.220
Not much, not much.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.660
It's a very specific degree,

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.180
it's not universally usable.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.320
A dentist says, is it fair to ask Christians

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.640
if they follow Jesus or Paul?

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.440
It seems like two very different religions.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.540
It is, Dennis, it is.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.600
And I've had a lot of people request to do a live stream

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.220
where I just say, you're not a Christian,

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.080
you're a Paulian.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.280
And while it's a very narrow topic,

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.740
which is why I haven't done it, it is true.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.140
When we talk about Bible contradictions,

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.740
I talk a lot about how Paul and Jesus

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.680
contradicted each other,

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.700
because I think it's important.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.080
If you are a modern day Christian,

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.000
you are following Paul, you're not following Jesus.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.020
That's just a cold hard truth.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.180
I've got some of the Jesus Paul contradictions

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.360
on the cheat sheet.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.080
Don says, an idea inspired either by Doug or Sparky,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.000
I can't choose.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.860
Does evolution present a problem for Christianity?

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.200
Required immortal soul in the unbroken line of life

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.780
whose mother didn't have a soul.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.340
So I agree with you.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.540
In fact, if you read,

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.120
there's a study Bible called the Didache Study Bible,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.900
if I remember correctly.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.060
I've got it, it's a Catholic study Bible,

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.940
and they've got an article written about this,

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.740
how Catholicism is always in agreement with science,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.520
even if it's hard to understand.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.520
And I had a professor who was part of the

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.640
BioLogos Foundation who believed in this kind of thing

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.360
where evolution is true, but so is the Bible.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.620
And this was the question I brought up to him,

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.920
and he didn't like it.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.740
He's a great guy, he just didn't like my question.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.100
But my question was exactly that.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.980
If in fact, evolution is true,

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.400
where did God draw the arbitrary line

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.880
of now we have humans that have like rights

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.200
and the image of God and the immortal soul?

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.520
Like where did that point start?

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.460
You have to draw a line somewhere.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.580
It's a silly thing to believe in,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.980
but if you're coping, this is a good advanced level of cope.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.340
I'm with you, I don't think there's a good answer for it.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.600
That's why it's a good question.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.840
Punctuated says, what do you think

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.300
of the Midianite hypothesis?

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.720
Punctuated, I believe wholeheartedly

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.140
in the Midianite hypothesis.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.060
I've got a bunch of articles and documents

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.980
and archeology that points towards this.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.100
If you DM me, I'll send you my articles.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.440
You can read all about it.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.880
I think the Midianite hypothesis is a great hypothesis

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.660
to explain the rise of Yahwism

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.420
and to explain the rise of Yahwism

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.920
specifically within Judea

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.680
and then eventually into all of Israel.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.200
Carnage, with another question, I love these questions,

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.300
thank you so much, Carnage,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.840
says, smash, marry or unalive, music edition,

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.600
Prince of Egypt, Jesus Christ Superstar,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.560
or the Book of Mormon?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.540
Listen, I'm gonna hurt your feelings.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.580
I have not seen Jesus Christ Superstar,

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700
which I don't know.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.680
I haven't even seen the Book of Mormon,

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.420
but if I'm gonna marry one of them,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.020
I know the premise of the Book of Mormon.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.560
I'm gonna marry the Book of Mormon.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.040
I'm going to smash Jesus Christ Superstar

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.820
because I think it's probably a little bit tongue in cheek

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.020
and I'm going to unalive the Prince of Egypt

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.280
only because it's boring

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.840
and we've already heard the Joseph story so many times.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.940
But good question, that's a tough one, actually.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.720
I appreciate that.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.580
All right, guys, I've got a couple more super chats.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.440
I like five, one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.780
I got eight more and then I gotta get off stream.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.300
I apologize, I can't stream later today,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.240
but I'll be doing a long stream tomorrow.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.360
Tomorrow's gonna be a long stream.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.720
It should be a lot of fun.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.480
Kyle, and I'm streaming Saturday and Sunday,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.540
so I'll be streaming over the weekend too,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.120
says, when you were a Christian,

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.900
did you believe or trust all the Bible narratives

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.520
such as the flood arc?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.620
If so, what about, or what,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.400
if so, what was that like?

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.160
And do you think Christians secretly doubt some parables

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.000
but still argue they're true?

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.980
Okay, so when I was a brand new evangelical Christian,

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.340
like I grew up in Catholicism

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.220
and they taught these stories

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.820
but they didn't really teach them at my Catholic school

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.160
like they were true history.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.860
They were akin to mythology.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.760
When I became a born again evangelical Christian,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.460
I was like, no, it's gotta be all true.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.580
It has to be all true.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.000
So I did have a period early on

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.360
where I was like, no, it's true.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.300
But I very quickly started studying the apologetics

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.420
on these topics and then studying the counter-apologetics

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.480
on these topics and quickly as an evangelical Christian,

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.060
I realized, oh no, they can't be literally true.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.020
The science is so against it.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.460
And so I quickly moved into back,

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.920
I reverted back to, okay, these are like theological

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.840
stories, they didn't literally happen

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.060
or some of them literally happened

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.860
but they were exaggerated, right?

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.100
And I did that for a little bit.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.100
I did that for a little bit.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.600
The reality is though,

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.080
once you study the New Testament

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.460
and realize that everybody in the New Testament

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.740
thought they were literal stories that literally happened,

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.620
yeah, you got big problems.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.500
They can't hold water.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.780
Emma says, can you go more in depth

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:20.220
on the differences merging of Judah and Israel?

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.560
Is this merger where Yahweh become one true God?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.820
Kind of, yes.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:30.340
So I'm gonna take you quickly to Exodus six.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.890
So in Exodus six,

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.790
we have a statement that's really interesting

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.330
and Mark Smith has written about this,

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.530
about how Israel went from a polytheistic worldview

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.070
eventually into a monotheistic worldview

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.290
but in Exodus six, we have a really strange thing

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.710
where Moses is given the name of the Lord

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.070
and it says, I appeared to Abraham,

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.950
Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.210
but by my name, Yahweh,

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.370
I did not make myself known to them.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.890
Well, this is kind of a weird thing, right?

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.370
When I read this, what I'm reading here

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.570
is that Yahweh is suggesting, listen,

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.130
I know your forefathers knew me as so and so

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.310
but my real name is Yahweh.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.170
This is a crazy thing to say if you're a Deity.

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:22.430
Why would you tell everyone that I'm Elohim, I'm El

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.750
and then a thousand years later be like,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.650
oh, by the way, my real name, my real name is Yahweh.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.550
Why, what are we doing here?

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.130
Why would we do that?

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:34.610
That's the dumbest thing ever.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.930
It doesn't make any sense.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.910
And so to me, there's lots of Bible passages

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.150
if you're reading carefully that seem like copes

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.030
and there's a lot of Bible passages that seem

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.730
like they were stolen from Israelite literature.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:53.290
For example, Psalm 74, Psalm 82.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.170
Psalm 82 classically talks

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.770
about how there are multiple gods.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.270
If you go to Psalm 82,

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.720
says God has taken his place in the divine council

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.060
in the midst of the gods, he holds judgment.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.860
This is in alignment with Israelite theology,

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.020
not Judean theology, right?

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.620
So the reality is it seems to be,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.960
if you read, go ahead and read the Bale cycle.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.960
Mark Smith did a really good translation of the Bale cycle

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.100
where you learn about El and his 70 sons

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.960
that he had with At-Tirot known as Asherah

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.560
and you learn about Bale and Anath

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.280
and all of these other deities

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.700
that show up in the Hebrew Bible.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.140
You, there's like 10 different deities

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.480
from the Israelite pantheon, the Canaanite pantheon

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.380
that show up in the Old Testament.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.260
And a lot of the words in Hebrew

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.280
were stolen directly from Ugaritic tradition.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:56.960
The word for death is moth or moth or muth

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.180
depending on how you conjugate the word.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:05.080
Well, the deity of death in the El pantheon,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.740
the pantheon of El, one of the children of El was moth.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.840
The sun deity, Shemesh or Shamash

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.520
is the word for sun in biblical Hebrew.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.000
Like we just, they merged two cultures.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.760
The Judeans worshiped Yahweh

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.560
probably through developed through the Midianite hypothesis.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.820
The Israelites worshiped El and the pantheon

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.200
that was associated with El.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.540
And eventually when the Judeans got powerful,

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.780
the Judeans took over Israel.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.340
They had to merge the religions.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.660
They had to merge the backgrounds.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.980
Again, I would read the writings of Mark S. Smith

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.520
on this and I would also read Yahweh

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.040
and the gods and goddesses of ancient Canaan

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.200
by John Day, great reads.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.880
Dave says, is there an argument to be made

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.740
that the apostles in part could have seen Jesus

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.700
as a way to change their station in life?

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.900
More respect, money.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.700
Well, that certainly is the case, Dave.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.900
A lot of people say, well, they wouldn't have lied.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.860
They had nothing to gain.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.480
We don't know that.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.200
In fact, we don't even know how they died.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.020
They could be they didn't even die as martyrs.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.520
Hundreds of years later,

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.100
people made up stories about how they died.

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.910
It could be that at the time of Jesus's death,

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.810
they had a big following of Galileans

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.550
and they had support.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:24.850
It's clear from the New Testament

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.570
that a lot of wealthy women were supporting the movement.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.270
They probably didn't wanna give up that cash cow.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:34.150
They probably wanted to continue that gravy train.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.690
Hey, we're just gonna keep doing this thing

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.730
and Jesus will come back eventually.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.210
But in the meantime, yeah,

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.910
we'll let all these women support our ministry.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:42.650
Why not?

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.140
I got a couple more super chats.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:46.820
Johanna says,

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.520
I'm going to make a t-shirt that says

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.060
everything I know about the Bible I learned from Justin.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.640
There's a lot about the Bible I don't know.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.500
There's a lot of good people out here to learn from.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.180
I'm humble that you think I'm one of them.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.540
I really appreciate that, Johanna.

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.380
At least I'm glad I can put my education to use.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.780
And Forum says,

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.760
what was the purpose of the story

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.040
of the lineage of Cain in Genesis?

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.340
Why did the author just leave off after the murder of Abel?

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.220
Okay, so the lineage in Genesis,

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.920
we're talking about Genesis chapter four and five.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.380
The purpose of these lineages

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.880
are to explain where things came from.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.960
Where did we get iron smelting?

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.480
Where did we get this people group from, right?

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.740
So the goal of this is to say,

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.020
okay, we've got these people groups.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.060
You know about them.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.600
Here's where they came from, right?

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.420
And what you'll find in Genesis,

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.900
when we get these people groups,

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.140
it's always the people groups that Israel don't like.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.520
These people, well, they came from bad ancestors.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.900
They came from people that were bad in the lineage.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.800
Like the descendants of Ham were the Canaanites

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.320
and the Canaanites were cursed

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.220
to be slaves to the Israelites.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.480
And so the justification for what they did

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.200
to the Canaanites was in fact the story of Noah, right?

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.860
So the lineage that we find in Genesis

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.800
is an explanation for the state of affairs

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.800
between them and the people groups around them.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.880
And the 10 commentorium says, prove me wrong.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.020
Israelites did not own chattel slaves

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.940
after being freed 400 years from slavery

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.980
and lived in the wilderness in tents with no farms.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.740
First chattel slaves were Midianite virgins

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.400
and Gibeonite males.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.720
Well, I mean, we have no reason to believe that.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.360
We hear about slaves even in the book of Exodus.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.260
If you just go to the book of Exodus

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.060
and do a word search on the word slaves,

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.420
it seems to be that they're being prepared

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.320
to own slaves while they're in the desert.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.500
And if the first time that they owned slaves

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.800
were the Midianite virgins,

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.760
you're referring to Numbers chapter 31,

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.160
that was while they were in the desert.

00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.020
Numbers 31 is while they were wandering around

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:00.680
in the desert.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.920
So if they took those virgins as slaves

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.580
and they killed all the Midianites,

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.160
then in fact, they owned slaves while they were

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.800
in the desert during the period of the Exodus.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.940
Numbers and Exodus run parallel to each other.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.720
They're not in the promised land yet

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.980
in the book of Numbers.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.260
I mean, they're spying the promised land.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:22.880
You know what I mean?

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.120
So I don't know what to tell you.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.720
The Israelites obviously did own chattel slaves

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.860
directly after being freed from slavery for 400 years

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.420
and the example you listed proves that I'm right.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.480
I don't know what to tell you.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.740
Thank you for the super chat though.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.660
And Godwin says, is Judaic circumcision

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.920
reformed human sacrifice?

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.540
I don't think so.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.440
I don't think it was a derivative of human sacrifice.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.340
What I think is they learned it from the Egyptians

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.780
who are already doing it,

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.680
which lends credence to the idea

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.060
that there was a contingent of Hebrew people

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.640
that did live either on the border of Egypt

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.560
or even in the land of Avaris that eventually left.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.180
Maybe they were part of the Hyksos expulsion, who knows?

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.540
What we do know is that they probably picked up

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:15.680
the act of circumcision from the Egyptians

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.600
and then when the Judeans became

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.760
the most powerful people in their narrative

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.360
was the end all be all of the people group,

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.900
obviously the circumcision,

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.280
they had to come up with a reason for it

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.740
and the reason for the circumcision

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.340
was explained through Abraham

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.760
because if they're gonna force it on everybody,

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.020
you need it to come from God.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.880
L-Teen says, no question, but just wanted to say,

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.240
I very much admire how much you prioritize your son

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.260
and spending time with him.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.080
Enjoy the beach, friend.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.060
Well, thank you so much, L-Teen.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.040
I really, really, really appreciate that.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:46.780
That's super generous.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.700
And the $50 super chat is very generous, L-Teen.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.060
Big W, big, big W.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.520
And Johanna says, you might earn, want?

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.880
You might want to marry Jesus Christ Superstar.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.060
He was very good looking.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.160
I'll consider that.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.140
I don't know who played it, who played the role.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.660
I'll take a look into it though.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.200
Thank you for the information.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.880
And Randy, thank you for sending out

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.780
10 deconstruction zone memberships.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.040
That's huge, my friend.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:14.800
Thank you so much.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.220
I've got two more.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.960
I got two more and I got to cut it, guys.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.440
Forum says, please enjoy your day at the beach.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.840
Have an ice cream on me.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.640
Well, thank you so much, Forum.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.780
And I think we will.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.040
I think we're going to have some ice cream.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.840
It should be a lot of fun.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.940
I'm looking forward to it.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.280
He's never been in a body of water with waves yet.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.640
We're going to, there's a big lake.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.780
I can't tell you what, that actually has waves.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.860
And I'm so excited because he's never seen waves before.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.200
So the first time a six-year-old experiences waves is fun.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.240
And last one says, thanks,

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.240
was just trying to give you a challenge.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.980
Listen, I love a good challenge.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.680
I appreciate a good, good challenge.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.460
And it certainly was, I think, in good faith.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.420
So big W to that.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.140
And I'll do another Q&A next week.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.720
So I apologize.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.200
This one had to be so short.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.720
Apologize, Streamlabs.

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.280
Obviously, this dogshit software sometimes.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.640
But I'll be live tomorrow doing debates.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.520
I'll be live Saturday and Sunday doing debates.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.960
And so there's gonna be lots of debates coming up

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.680
and I'll make sure and plan time

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.800
for a longer Q&A next week.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.340
We can get all of our questions out.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.840
Apologize, we have to cut this one short.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.660
But thank you so much for being here, friends.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:28.320
Love and.
