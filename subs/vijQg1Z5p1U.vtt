00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.920
How you doing David?

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.880
Hey, how's it going? Good. How you doing?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.820
I'm awesome. All right. Are you at least 18 and are you a believer?

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.020
I am both. Awesome. And which God do you believe in?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.000
I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Yahuwah.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.440
Okay. Do you believe in Jesus?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.120
I do.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.680
Okay. So also there's like some radio or TV in the background. Can you turn that down?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.400
That's football.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.280
Yeah. Can you turn it down?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.520
I mean, you can definitely watch it, but we don't need to hear it.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.730
Also, I forgot to set my lineup today. I hope I don't have anyone injured playing.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.570
My goodness. I'll be in a lot of trouble if I've got an injury on my lineup.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.390
It's the Lions and Texans. Nobody's getting injured.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.110
All right. So what's your most convincing evidence or argument for why the Christian God is real?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.500
The Word itself is the evidence because the Word is inspired by God.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.140
And how do you know that to be the case?

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.110
When Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, he was inspired by God when he wrote it.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.750
He wrote it through direct testimony of the people that were actually in the lineage when the things happened in the book.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.450
How do you know that Moses wrote it?

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.750
If you read the first five books of the Torah or the Bible, it tells you that he wrote it.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.530
Actually, it doesn't. Can you give me that citation?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.260
Because there's a bunch of passages that clearly make it impossible for him to write it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.420
So, for example, Genesis 14, 14.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:59.800
When Abraham heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.680
Where is Dan, according to the Bible?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.750
Dan is where it's now Syria.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.430
Yep. It's at the edge of Syria. It's like the northernmost tribe.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.970
And when was Dan established?

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.470
What's your name?

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.190
When was Dan established?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.070
I'm going to answer that. What's your name?

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.270
Yohannes.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.430
Yohannes. Are you the only Yohannes that's ever been born?

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.670
We're talking about a region.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.690
I got that. Are you the only Yohannes that's ever been born?

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.150
Yep.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.170
Is there any other person on the earth named Yohannes?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.710
Oh, yeah.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.430
Is it possible?

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.830
So you're assuming that Dan, who is a child of Israel, Jacob, is the same Dan that they're pertaining to?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.930
No, it's not a person. It's a location.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.670
It's a location named after a person.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.310
And when did that person live?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.000
Obviously before Abraham.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.330
Nope. The tribe of Dan was established after the conquest.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.430
In fact, it was long after the conquest.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.170
That's exactly why I said that first.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.790
There we go. Okay, so there's no evidence.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.730
There's no evidence that the person that is named after is the son of Israel, but it's not. It's another person named Dan.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.890
It's not. Okay, that's just a nonsense claim in history.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.270
You can't find me any evidence that there was a location named Dan before the Iron Age.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.410
Well, before the Late Bronze Age.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.370
You're just making up stuff now.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.690
No, I'm not saying anything.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:53.070
The location of Dan was established by the tribal allotment of Dan in the Bible, which means Moses didn't write it, because Moses died before the tribal allotment was given.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.800
Again, you're assuming that that Dan that they're talking to was named after the son of Israel, and it was not. It was a different Dan.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.200
Yes.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.780
That established a city state in the northernmost region of Israel.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.460
It just happened to be named Dan.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:25.540
And then hundreds and hundreds of years later, a guy named Dan, who had a people group named after him called Dan, reestablished the exact same people group in the exact same location.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.760
That's what you think happened?

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.370
I don't believe it was the exact same location, but I believe that's a possibility.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.450
That's crazy. That's crazy.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.950
So the fact of the matter is, there was no tribe of Dan up there until the Israelites established it.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.630
That's just factually untrue.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.650
It also says crazy things as well.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.450
So, for example, in the book of Genesis, it talks about, was it chapter 36?

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.970
Give me a second to find the passage.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.010
There we go.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.310
Yeah, chapter 36, 31 was the one I was thinking of.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.100
It says, These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.360
Wow, it really seems like whoever wrote this wrote after the Israelites had their first king.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.120
No, the first five books of the Bible are history and a chronology, just like the book of Kings and Judges and Chronicles.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.880
You didn't hear what I said.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.800
It's a chronology.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.200
Whoever's writing here says that these are the kings who reigned in Edom, in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over Israel.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.460
So whoever's writing this knows that there have been kings in Israel.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.940
There were.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.460
Yeah, and he's talking about them in the past tense.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.960
He's saying before any king reigned in the land of Edom.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.460
That's the kings of Edom, not the kings of Israel.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.160
Keep reading.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.500
Before what?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.880
Before any kings reigned over Israel.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.900
Yes, and when was there a king in Israel?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.160
Who's the first king?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.400
There were no kings, there were judges.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.180
Yes, and when was the first king?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.880
Deborah.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.620
No, Deborah was a judge.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.680
Who was the first king?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.910
I mean, I'll take that.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.210
I mean, everyone knows it here except for the guest.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.910
Go ahead, Deb.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.610
Samuel.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.750
Nope, he was a prophet.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.150
Samuel was a king.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.710
No, he wasn't.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.790
And Saul was a king.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.950
Saul was the first king.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.590
Saul was the first king.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.370
He was anointed by Samuel, and that was hundreds of years after Moses.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.630
That's around the turn of the century, around 1000.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.670
So, whoever wrote this obviously wrote after Israel had some kings because he's saying

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:02.170
that some things happened, and these things happened before any king had yet to reign

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.170
over Israel.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.080
So it's clearly not Moses.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.260
And we've literally just begun.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.850
Do you think that Moses wrote about his own death?

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.270
No.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.110
Oh, you don't think so?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.670
So he couldn't have written that portion.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.330
What about Numbers 12-3?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:44.810
It says, the man Moses was very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.090
earth.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.550
Do you think Moses wrote that he was the most humble man on earth?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.970
Did you hear my question?

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.310
Yes, and I think that if you write a biography about yourself that it's possible for

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.830
you to do so, to relate yourself into the third person.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.810
So you think Moses literally wrote that he is the most humble man on earth?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.360
Mine says meat, but yeah, I agree with that.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.520
Okay, so the most humble man on earth said that he's the most humble man on earth.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.190
Is it humble to brag about yourself?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.670
That's not boasting or bragging.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.830
Okay, so when he says he's the most humble man on earth, that's not boasting

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.270
or bragging.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.550
Okay.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.830
No.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.990
Fantastic.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.370
And what do we do?

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.390
Oh, shoot.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.550
I just copy and pasted.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.310
All right, I copied one I should have pasted.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.870
Let me grab another verse.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.010
Leviticus 8-21 is really interesting.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.450
It says, after the entrails, this is referring to the Levitical sacrifices,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.270
what to do with the animals.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.590
After the entrails and the legs were washed with water, Moses turned into smoke

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.370
the rest of the ram on the altar.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.630
It was a burnt offering for a pleasing odor, an offering made by fire to the Lord,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.290
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.130
Why is Moses constantly writing about himself in the third person?

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:24.730
Can you find a single historical work in all of history where this is how the story

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.790
is told, a person writing about himself in the third person?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.700
The Autobiography of Malcolm X.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.910
I actually haven't read that.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.930
Anyone here read that one?

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.720
Does Malcolm X write the entire story in the third person?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.900
Yes, he does.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.740
So he doesn't say I in the book.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.540
Frederick Douglass did the same thing.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.120
You might be right.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.720
I haven't read it.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.120
I don't know.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.680
Anyone else here actually read that?

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.530
I'm going to pull it up.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.850
I guarantee I can get a PDF copy of it.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.190
I'm hearing a lot of people in the comments have read it and said that's not what

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.470
happened.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.770
They said it's in the first person.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.150
Are you lying to me right now?

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:21.860
Oops.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.380
So this is being told by Alex Haley, not by Malcolm X.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.100
So when you say that, perfect.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.640
So when you say that, is it possible that Moses could have...

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.380
I'm sure you're aware of the Koran, how the Prophet Muhammad transcribed...

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.720
He didn't actually transcribe the Koran because he was illiterate, but what he

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.560
did was he told his brother and his brother wrote it down.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.160
Now, is it possible that Moses could have told this story to someone else,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.220
possibly Aaron, possibly non, and they wrote it down for him?

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.000
It's possible.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.100
We have no evidence of it.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.920
Also, Malcolm X's autobiography is in the first person.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.740
I remember waking up to the sound of my mother's screaming again.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.800
When I scrambled out, I saw the place in the living room.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.200
They were there trying to calm her down.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.600
The whole thing's in the first person.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.120
You need to repent for lying.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.620
Perhaps a bigger point here is that just because something is possible doesn't mean

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.320
it's likely.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.260
The time to believe is after sufficient evidence.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.040
If you start with the assumption that it has to be this belief, then yeah,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.140
you're going to come to that conclusion.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.760
But then that just says, do you actually care about the truth over being

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.100
comfortable with what you're trying to do?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.720
Yeah, it sounds to me like he's, rather than saying this is the best

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.960
answer for the evidence that we have, he's trying to run towards,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.080
well, as long as it's possible, then it's still true.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.860
But something being possible doesn't make it true.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.780
What makes it likely to be true is whether or not the evidence actually

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.740
points towards it.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.220
Exodus chapter 3, verse 13.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.440
Then Moses said to God, if I, I come to the people of Israel and say to

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.220
them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.520
And they asked me, what is the name?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.000
What shall I say to them?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.660
Yeah, because it's recording a conversation of Moses.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.100
And that's what Moses said.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.180
So that's what we agree on.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.120
Yeah, it said Moses said something.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.680
So that is possibly it was written by someone else.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.320
It's clearly written by somebody else.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.480
No, I don't believe it's verbalized by Moses because the author knows

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.720
things that Moses wouldn't have known.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.380
And it also gets facts wrong.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.560
For example, it says that they built the storehouses of Pitham and

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.160
Ramses.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.280
That could only be true if whoever was writing was writing after the

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.040
1200s.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.560
But Moses, according to the Bible, made an Exodus in the 1400s.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.740
So 200 years off.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.270
That was around 1256.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.490
The Exodus was around 1256.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.910
Not according to First Kings.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.630
Have you read First Kings?

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.130
I have.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.390
And what does it say?

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.870
I'll put it on the screen.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.990
First Kings, Chapter 6.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.210
In the 480th year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.650
in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.870
in the month of Ziv, which is the second month,

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.470
he began to build the house of the Lord.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.890
So according to First Kings, Chapter 6,

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.310
the Exodus was 480 years prior to Solomon beginning the building of the

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.590
temple.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.930
And that started in 970 BCE.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:40.930
So all he's got to do then is take 970 and figure out what 480 years is.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.030
It puts you right in the middle of the 1400s.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.170
Yep.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.870
1450.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.330
So no way they built the storehouses of Pitham's and Ramses when

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.070
Ramses was still 200 years away from being born.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.330
There's no...

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:12.850
What's that, Phil?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.270
I said darn those pesky facts.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.750
I know, right?

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.070
There's just no evidence in the book that Moses wrote it.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:26.330
Like you only believe Moses wrote it because you want to believe Moses wrote it,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.210
but the evidence doesn't point towards that.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.240
Okay, next.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:34.600
All right.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.860
We'd also do Genesis 21, which is highly anachronistic.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.780
It says, When they made a covenant at Beersheba,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.020
Abimelek, with Fakol, the commander of his army,

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.380
left and returned to the land of the Philistines.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:58.060
But the Philistines hadn't existed in the land of Israel until the

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.950
There was no Philistines at the time of Abraham and Abimelek.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.950
So whoever wrote this obviously wrote after the Philistines entered the land.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.130
So it's not just not from Moses.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.630
It's also just not true.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.810
And it's full of other errors.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.850
Like the Messiah in this book can't quote the Old Testament correctly.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.430
He misquotes it every time.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.210
He didn't fulfill any prophecies.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.230
Daniel Silva, thank you for the super chat.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.950
Daniel says, Debate Sam Shamoon and God Logic.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.270
WrestleMania.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.910
Yeah.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.690
I mean, listen, I'll debate anybody.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.390
I don't really care who it is, but I can't control who comes on the platform, you know.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.370
Do you believe that the earth stood still, according to Joshua chapter 10?

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:01.810
I do.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.150
What would happen if the earth stopped rotating?

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.170
It would sink out of orbit.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.430
They'd do a lot of things.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:08.650
Yeah.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:14.710
The Philistines first appear in historical records around 1200 BCE.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.150
So I said 1170 during the collapse.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.570
And Moses lived in the 1400s according to 1 Kings chapter 6.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.730
So there's no way that Moses wrote about the Philistines.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.240
So since the Bible was written in Hebrew, the Torah anyway, they were referring to the HaPeleshim.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.500
And that was the tribe that proceeded to Philistines.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.840
So when you translate that word into English, as the Bible is written, that we can understand it.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.360
That race was there.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.120
Which race?

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.740
And that's who they were referring to.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.820
Which race?

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.980
The HaPeleshim.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.340
The HaPeleshim.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.440
That's not actually what's in the Hebrew, if I had to take a guess.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.540
Let me see what's actually there.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.660
Yeah, the Philistines.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.680
Philishtim.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.160
Philishtim.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.240
That's what it says.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:11.800
Yes.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:12.740
Philishtim.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:14.620
Philishtim.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.120
Yeah.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.140
The Philistines.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.840
They didn't exist at the time of Moses, so I'm trying to tell you.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.480
Whoever wrote the book of Genesis lived after the Philistines entered the land.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.120
Next.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.600
All right.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.000
Let's do one of my favorites.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.920
Do you think that God is perfectly just?

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.020
I do.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.020
Do you think that God would execute people that didn't commit a crime?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.620
I do.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.020
So God is just, and he also executes people even though they haven't committed a crime.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.600
The person's definition of a crime varies from person to person.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.460
God's law is concrete.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.080
If that person does not honor God's law, then they're guilty of committing a crime.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.380
That's what I'm saying.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.100
For someone who hasn't committed the crime that they're accused of.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.300
What crime didn't they commit?

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.840
I'll show you.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:29.560
Suppose a man marries a woman, but after going into her dislikes her, makes up charges against her, slandering her by saying,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.760
I married this woman, but when I lay with her I did not find evidence of her virginity.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:40.740
The father of the young woman and her mother shall then submit the evidence of the young woman's virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.300
And the father of the young woman shall say to the elders,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.680
I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.040
Now he's made up charges against her, saying I did not find evidence of your daughter's virginity.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.200
But here is the evidence of my daughter's virginity.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.340
Then they shall spread out the cloth before the elders of the town.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:06.800
So the test here is that if she bled on a cloth during their first nuptials, then she was a virgin.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.820
And if she didn't bleed on the cloth, then she wasn't a virgin.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.280
Were we tracking so far?

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.400
Apparently, God didn't know that only 42% of women bleed their first time.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.740
Yeah, that's the first problem.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.780
Also, Claudia, thank you for the 666. Big W, Claudia. Big W, 666.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.400
So, only a half of women actually bleed the first time they do the deed.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:37.140
Hey Justin, there's some technical difficulties and we can't mute the mic. Can you mute us?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.980
Yeah, I got you. I got you.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.500
All right, we're good.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.760
So now let's look at the punishments, right?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.720
If the guy is lying that she actually was a virgin,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.420
it says that the elders of the town are going to take the man and they're going to punish him.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.680
And they're going to fine him a hundred shekels and then she's his permanent wife.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:03.320
But if she's lying, it says if however the charge is true that evidence of the young woman's virginity was not found,

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.240
then they'll bring the young woman out to the entrance of her father's house

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.400
and the men of the town will stone her until she's done alive.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.060
So if he lies, he pays a fine. If she lies, she gets executed.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.280
That's the second problem.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.670
I agree with the feminist age and all of that,

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:28.030
that the inequality for the punishments between males and females in the Hebrew age were unjust,

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.370
but that's just the way that they were.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.610
So God was unjust?

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.830
No.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.710
God gave the command.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.560
Have you read Deuteronomy? Do you know that God, all the commands come from God?

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.280
Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 1 through 2 says,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.160
So now Israel, give heed to the statutes and ordinances that I am commanding you to observe,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:02.800
so that you may live to enter and occupy the land that the Lord the God of your ancestors is giving you.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.820
You must neither add anything to what I am commanding you nor take anything away from it,

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.880
but keep the commandments of the Lord your God with which I am charging you.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.840
So all the commands given in Deuteronomy are from God.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.460
Yes, they are.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.160
So God said to execute women that don't bleed on their wedding night,

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:25.340
and he sentenced 50% of them to their own execution knowing that they didn't do anything wrong.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.800
That's not the case.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.660
That is the case.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:36.460
He said in that instance, if a man claims that his woman was not a virgin,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.660
then that was the punishment if she was lying and saying,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.060
I am a virgin and she was found not to be, if she was lying.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.840
And what's the proof?

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:54.120
What you're implying is that the 50% of the women who didn't bleed automatically were brought into that court,

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.120
and that allegation was made against them, and that's just not true.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.560
What I'm saying is according to the text, if an allegation is made...

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.520
If an allegation is made, there's a key point.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:11.520
Yes, and I never said every single time that a man charged his woman if she didn't bleed.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.520
No one ever made that claim.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.380
What I'm saying is that when this happens, when a woman is brought up on charges,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.640
only about 50% of them are actually going to be guilty.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:28.340
Okay, and out of those 50%, how many of their husbands are actually going to bring that case to the elders

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.760
and actually say, okay, she's not a virgin?

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.520
It doesn't matter.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.780
That's highly unlikely.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:38.220
No, it's quite likely because we know it was happening because the Jewish rabbis wrote about it in the Talmud.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.840
So it doesn't matter how often it happened.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.160
If it happened only twice, it's still too much.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.360
No, she broke the law.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.960
If she lied, she broke the law.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.740
If he lied, he broke the law and he paid a fine.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.660
If she lied, she got executed.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.180
That's God's law.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.500
I know it's God's law and it's barbaric.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.740
If you get pulled over, let's say this.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:07.760
If you get pulled over and you don't have a license on you or whatever the case may be and you receive a traffic ticket,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.080
then you might feel that that is jest or ingest.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:17.300
If a totally different person gets pulled over under the same circumstances and they face a different punishment,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.180
then they might feel that it is unjust.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.540
Looking at the two together, one might say, okay, this is fair and this is not.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.380
David, we're talking about executing women.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.580
We're not talking about paying a fine.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.120
We're talking about executing a woman.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.340
And according to the regulation given, only half of them would have actually been guilty.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.560
I agree at that point.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.580
Okay, so your God's a monster.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.440
Not at all.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.420
Okay, so why is he executing women that are innocent?

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.300
He doesn't execute them.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.380
The people execute them.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.400
It was just his commandment.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.600
But God told him to do it.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.480
In fact, he says you must do it.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.820
He didn't give them the option.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.300
He says you must do it.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.100
So you shall purge the evil from your midst, he says.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.760
That's God's command.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.880
That's God's command.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.580
He didn't say you get to do it.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.300
He says you must do it.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:19.540
So God is commanding these young women to go to their death, knowing that only half of them would have actually committed the crime.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.200
Now, I don't even care if they did commit the crime.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.320
Even if they did commit the crime, I don't think they should be stoned.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.480
If they committed the crime, they lied.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.580
No, incorrect.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.880
And also, if they committed the crime, that means they lied.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.460
This is what it says.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.860
If they're found guilty, if they're found guilty, what's the evidence?

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.300
What is the evidence?

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.100
David, what is the evidence?

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.740
The evidence is that she lied about her virginity.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.180
No, that's the claim.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.460
All right, I'll fix you up here in a second, David.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.000
Daniel Silva, thank you for the $5 super chat.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.700
Daniel says, to the caller, are you God's advocate?

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.060
You're bending the rules for God's image.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.860
Isn't it unjust to virgins who don't bleed, he gave the order to?

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.320
Yeah.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.040
That's what I'm trying to say here, David.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:28.700
The only evidence that you need to execute a woman is whether or not she bleeds on a sheet.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:36.080
And we know physiologically that only half of women, actually slightly less than half of women, actually bleed their first time.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:44.420
Which means if a case is brought, and they were, only half of the women found guilty would have been actually guilty in real life.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.060
Do you understand the problem here, David?

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.560
I'm not sure he grasps the severity of the situation.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.130
Well, guys, while David's trying to figure out his unmute button, thank you for being here.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.530
Let's tap and share and like.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.530
You are muted, David.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.770
Yes, I can't unmute you.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.690
You have to unmute yourself.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.590
I see your comment.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.150
You got to unmute yourself, my man.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:11.510
OK.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:12.930
There we go.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.730
Can you hear me?

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.030
Yeah.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.150
So do you understand that according to the rules given, innocent women would have been executed?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.460
They wouldn't be innocent.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.480
Let me tell you why.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.080
Because first they lied, and then it speaks to the woman.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.720
David, how do you know if they lied?

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.480
It speaks to the woman.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.940
David, how do you know if they lied?

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.920
David, I'm stopping you.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.740
How do you know if the woman lied?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.520
What is the test?

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.010
He doesn't get it.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.890
Or he's just spiraling out.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:59.250
The test is in the Hebrew culture as well as the Muslim culture.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.610
When a woman is given, they are tested.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.690
If you're aware of anatomy and physiology, you know that a female has a hymen.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:07.870
That's not true.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.250
That's true in modern times.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.130
It's not true of what happened here in the text.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.150
It doesn't say in the text that she's going to be examined.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:19.530
None of that said.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:27.490
It says that the only evidence you need is the sheet.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.250
That's it.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.130
It doesn't say nothing about inspecting anybody's vajayjay.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.680
That's what was done back then in order to validate that.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.300
Prove it.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.110
So now you're just making stuff up.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.630
I'm not making it up. That's what it was.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.710
Then why do they need the sheet?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.140
That's where the sheet came from.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.720
The sheet's not from the inspection.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.080
The sheet is from what happens when you go into your wife.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.140
That's why it says when he goes into her.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.890
David, you're lying and you're making stuff up again on the Bible.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.150
Without lies, Christianity dies, guys.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.140
There's no lie here.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:14.920
There's a lie.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.440
The only evidence you need is whether or not she bled on that sheet.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.460
Now that I've got you, I want to talk about my absolute favorite topic

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.820
because we can talk about how barbaric your God is

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.120
and you'll make excuses for your barbaric God every day of the week, I'm sure of it.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.840
But I want to talk about my favorite topic ever

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:43.460
and that is what prophecies did Jesus actually fulfill?

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:57.050
613 prophecies in the book of Daniel, in the book of Isaiah, in the book of Psalms, in the book of Joel, in the book of Hosea.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.050
Can you name one of them?

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:58.690
Malachi.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.510
Name one of them. Stop yapping and name one.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.790
I'm going to Isaiah 53.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.790
This is not going to turn out well for you.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.170
Have you read all of Isaiah?

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.210
I have.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:18.510
Okay, and do you know when I say something like first Isaiah and second Isaiah, do you know what that means?

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.120
When you imply the number before the book, that implies that there are more than one book, that there is only one book of Isaiah.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.420
That's not what that means.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:35.160
So when I say first Isaiah and second Isaiah and third Isaiah, I'm referring to the section of the text.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:43.100
So the section that I'm referring to is second Isaiah, specifically is Isaiah 40 all the way to chapter 55.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.620
And do you want to know why it's called second Isaiah?

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.380
Go ahead and explain.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.860
It's called second Isaiah because it was written 200 years after Isaiah, the first half was written.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.900
So the prior chapters of Isaiah were written before the Assyrian invasion.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:12.640
And the chapters in second Isaiah are written just prior, if not just after the Persians marched in under the leadership of King Cyrus.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.000
So either one of two things is true.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.260
Either Isaiah lived for over 200 years or there were multiple authors.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.620
Either way, it doesn't matter to me if he authored or not.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.940
I only bring that up because second Isaiah puts together a very coherent section of text.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:38.160
What is being addressed in second Isaiah is not the same events that are being addressed in first Isaiah.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:46.400
What's being addressed in second Isaiah is the release of the captives from Babylon and how God is going to restore his people after the Babylonian captivity.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.900
Also good to see a good faith, Gary.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:50.480
Yes.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.800
Glad to be here for a good faith dialectic as always.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:00.560
Well, he tried to defend how his God is still good, even though he executes virgins innocently.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.620
But you're going to have a little bit of that.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.400
Can I get a critique?

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:05.700
No, I'm kidding.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.020
Here's one.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.340
Here's one if you're listening.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.120
Are you listening?

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.380
Yeah, we're listening.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.080
Are you listening?

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.920
Isaiah 54.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.120
Isaiah 55 verse 8.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.280
Yeah, I'm sure you want to skip ahead.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.160
No, for my thoughts are not your thoughts.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.980
Neither are your ways my ways.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.260
That's adorable.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:24.840
All right.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.920
So let's read Isaiah 41.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.440
Says, but you Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I've chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.740
Who's the servant in Isaiah 41 8 through 9?

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.470
Just so you know, David, when you angrily flip the pages, we can't hear anything other

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.350
than page flipping.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.560
I'm not up to speed on the internet yet.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.260
I'm still using the original Bible.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.880
That's okay.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.500
I'm just saying that your page flipping is loud.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.900
Also, Conquistador, thank you for the $5 super chat.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.880
Conquistador says, why couldn't God make a nice happy people prophecy like petting

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.620
a cow or something?

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.480
Why is everything revolved around death or something of that kind?

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:02.720
He did.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.160
He did.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.120
In Psalms, he says that the cow shall lie with the, the lamb shall lie with the wolf

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.260
and the snake and the lion and all of that.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.340
That's Isaiah, Isaiah chapter 2, 11 and Micah 4.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.720
Yeah.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.480
Okay.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.580
So in Isaiah 41 8 through 9, who is, who's the servant?

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.340
It's on the screen right here.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.650
The servant is the people of Israel.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.470
Oh, gotcha.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.110
Okay.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:28.430
Gotcha.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.850
Okay.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.450
So the servant is Israel.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.410
In 43 10, it says, you are my witnesses, says the Lord and my servant who I have

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:35.690
chosen.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:36.650
Who's he talking to?

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:38.810
The people of Israel.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.230
Okay.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.550
So the people of Israel is the servant.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:40.830
Gotcha.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.170
Okay.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:47.130
Isaiah 44 1 says, but here are now, O Jacob, my servant in Israel, whom I have chosen.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.090
Who's the servant here?

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.230
The people of Israel.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.010
Oh, gotcha.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.350
Jacob and Israel are the same person.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.170
Okay.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.430
Yeah.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:53.790
Okay.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.750
Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:56.710
You are my servant.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.170
That's 44 21.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.050
So it's still Israel.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:32:59.370
Okay.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:04.750
So for the sake of my servant, Jacob, and Israel, my chosen, I call you by your name.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.570
So in 45 verse 4, it's Israel, the servant?

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.110
It's the same thing.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.530
Gotcha.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.890
44, sorry, 48 20.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:14.830
Go out from Babylon.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.010
Flee from Chaldea.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.570
Declare this with a shout of joy and proclaim it.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.910
Send it forth to the ends of the earth and say the Lord has redeemed his servant,

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:22.390
Jacob.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.530
Who's the servant here?

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.810
Jacob and Israel are the same person who's talking about the tribe of Israel.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.070
Sure.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:34.130
So it almost seems like in 2nd Isaiah, there's a theme building that the servant

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.630
is the nation of Israel and God is doing something rather spectacular with the nation

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.150
of Israel.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.710
So when I get to 53, why would I read that the servant is anybody but the nation

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.810
of Israel when he keeps telling you over and over again that it's not Israel

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.150
and it's not a messiah, it's actually Israel?

00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.780
Why would he just ignore all the context of 2nd Isaiah and just say,

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.840
oops, now that we're in a new chapter, the servant somehow, his magic identity

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.640
is now different?

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.110
Because that's going to be the new one.

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:12.670
That's going to be the new servant.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.270
How do you know?

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.550
He's talking about the messiah.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.370
How do you know?

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.340
Does it say the messiah?

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.310
Because there's only one messiah ever mentioned in 2nd Isaiah and his name

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.030
is Cyrus.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.610
The only king, the only messiah ever mentioned is King Cyrus.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:39.010
It doesn't say anything about King David in 2nd Isaiah sitting on the throne,

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.830
nothing of that nature.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.620
He is mentioned in Isaiah chapter 11 and chapter 2 though.

00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.330
So Isaiah 53 clearly couldn't be about Jesus when it's about the nation

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:53.930
of Israel.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:56.470
Thank you, Evan.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.930
I appreciate the drinks and the turkey.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.170
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.300
Did you have anything else?

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:13.860
Zachariah 99, Micah 5-2, Isaiah 7-14, Jeremiah 31-15, Psalm 8-2, Psalm 22-16,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.840
Genesis 3-15.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.310
That's talking about Jesus.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.550
Which one?

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.350
All of them.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.090
All of them?

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.130
Let's go to my favorite, one of my favorites here.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:35.550
I love Zachariah 99 and Good Faith Gary probably knows this one.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.610
Gary, have you ever read a donkey before?

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.150
Have I ever rode a donkey?

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.830
I can't say that I have, no.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.610
I've rode a donkey and you're about to find out that that makes me the messiah.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:57.950
Because it says, according to Matthew 21, it says that Jesus rode that donkey

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.210
in order to fulfill what was written by the prophets.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.490
And this is what he quoted.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.570
Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.110
Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.370
See, your king comes to you, triumphant and victorious is he, humble.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:13.610
Riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey, he will cut off the chariot from Ephraim

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.370
and the war horse from Jerusalem.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.810
And the battle bow will be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:22.970
And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:28.370
Was Jesus a victorious king who cut off all war from Ephraim and Israel?

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:35.210
Yes.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.390
Oh, I'd love to see the citation for that.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.210
Please show me where Jesus was an actual king that ended all war in Israel.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.070
Yeah, I'm dying to know the verse.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:53.410
Yeah, I mean, the guy's got the name Yeshua in his screen, so maybe he knows more than I do.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.410
Maybe there's like a special Hebrew translation.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:05.170
You're thinking of the literal war, a literal war between Ephraim and Israel.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:05.910
Oh, it's figurative.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:07.890
Oh, there's not a war.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.540
That hasn't happened yet.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.300
Okay, so then the prophecy's not fulfilled, so Matthew lied.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.200
The prophecy will be fulfilled.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.520
But it wasn't fulfilled, which means Matthew lied.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.860
No, just that part. He's talking about nine.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.400
Oh, the part about riding the donkey was fulfilled.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:30.640
Yes.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.300
Oh, shit, I told you. I'm the Messiah. I rode a donkey.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.160
I rode a donkey twice. That makes me the Messiah. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:47.360
Cool. I didn't need any worship, but since you're here, David, I wouldn't stop you if you prayed to me right now.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.820
You're welcome to pray to me, though.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.240
I can't guarantee that I'll answer your prayer because I work in mysterious ways, though.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.260
Emre, thank you for the glasses.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.260
I pray to God and God alone.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.740
I'm sure you do.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.040
All right, let's look at another lie from the New Testament.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.920
One of my favorites is Jeremiah 31, and Jeremiah 31-15 doesn't get a lot of love.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.420
That's the Old Testament.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.060
That's where the prophecies come from.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.420
It's quoted in Matthew chapter 2, verse 28.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.160
You can test my memory on that. I'm pretty sure that's where it's at.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:28.780
So it says in Matthew chapter 2, verse 28, that the women were weeping over all the children that were executed in and around Bethlehem in order to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.780
And then it quotes Jeremiah 31-15.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.800
It says, Thus saith the Lord, a voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.620
Rachel is weeping for her children.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.140
She refuses to be comforted for her children because they are no more.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:50.180
Thus saith the Lord, keep your voice from weeping, your eyes from tears, for there is reward for your work, says the Lord, they shall come back from the land of the enemy.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:50.740
Oops.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.740
Jeremiah is writing just prior to the Babylonian invasion in 605.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.900
And he's comforting the mothers that are about to watch their children get exiled saying you don't have to cry.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.660
They're going to come back.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:08.700
And you know in Jeremiah, as well as I do, that they were only supposed to be gone for 70 years and then they were going to come back.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.040
That's the whole crux of the Jeremiah prophecy.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.540
So this is not about a messiah whatsoever.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:20.420
This is about the Jewish people going into exile and comforting the weeping mothers.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:31.080
So I'm like really trying to figure out how these dead babies in Bethlehem fulfilled this prophecy when this prophecy had nothing to do with dead babies during the time of the Messiah.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.640
You're speaking about when Herod came and he killed all of the children under the age of two in Bethlehem in the region of Judea.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.420
That's what it says.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.380
And that's where they got the context from, yes.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.480
But the context of the prophecy is not about the Messiah or about Bethlehem.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:02.640
It's about the women watching their children going into the Babylonian exile and being comforted that they're going to come back.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:06.920
Nothing to do with the Messiah.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.690
So again, Matthew's a liar.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:20.010
No.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.530
Oh, OK, it's wrong, but he's not a liar.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:25.830
Matthew just made a mistake.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.950
His readings not so good.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:29.770
Have you considered?

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:30.470
No.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.910
Actually, the retort that I get and it's a very effective one.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.530
The retort I get the most is na-ah.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.710
Also, Claudia, thank you for the 666.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.730
Big W, Claudia.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.510
I appreciate the 666.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:48.350
Also, Kayla, thank you for the five dollars.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:53.990
Kayla says, Hail Lilith, the wife of Adam, first wife of Adam, great mother and the succubi.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.790
Yeah, I think it's succubus.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:41:01.490
Depending which language you're in, succubi would be plural in Latin, but that's neither here nor there.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.190
So I want to read perhaps another prophecy that you might have heard.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.710
And I want your take on it.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.490
This is Hosea chapter 11.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:11.750
I forgot my 11.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:12.530
There we go.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.090
When Israel was a child, I loved him.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.890
And out of Egypt, I called my son.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.330
And the more that I called them, the more that they went for me.

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:24.390
And they kept sacrificing to the Baals and offering incense to idols.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.510
Is this a history about the Exodus?

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.590
Is that what's happening here?

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.050
No.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:31.350
Oh, no.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:40.890
So when God said in Exodus 422 that Israel is my firstborn son and he's freeing them from Egypt, that's not what this is referring to?

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:48.860
No.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:58.770
Exodus 422, you shall say to Pharaoh, thus saith the Lord, Israel is my firstborn son.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:01.430
That's what's obviously happening here.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.730
You have Flanker 420.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.990
Is the classic Christian defense?

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:06.250
No.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.430
Okay.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:17.950
So clearly Hosea is referencing Exodus 422 when the firstborn son of God left Egypt.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:19.830
When Israel was a child, I loved him.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.310
And out of Egypt, I called my son.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.810
And then what happened after they left Egypt?

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:25.410
Do you remember?

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.550
They wandered the wilderness for 40 years.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:30.830
And they built a calf.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.750
They worshiped idols, which is why it says the more that I called them, the more that they went for me.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:42.090
And they kept sacrificing to the Baals and offering incense to idols, which describes exactly what they did.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:42.690
Okay.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.830
So this is just history.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:46.790
There's no prophecy here.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:56.060
I'm guessing that that was the way that Matthew interpreted it.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:03.080
Matthew just looked at anything he could find in the Old Testament that sounded vaguely familiar to Jesus.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.380
And then he just called it a prophecy.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.520
But as it turns out, telling the story of the Exodus is not a prophecy.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.660
That's called history.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.660
Matthew is the worst exegete on the planet ever.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:30.200
In fact, I had a professor in Bible college that joked that if you turn in an exegesis paper that uses the same level of exegesis as the New Testament authors, you will get an F.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:39.040
That's how bad the New Testament authors exegeted the Old Testament, that even Christian professors know how bad it is.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:41.640
I agree.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:48.280
So again, we've got a big problem that Matthew keeps telling lies.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.470
But how does that relate to Jesus and God telling lies?

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.030
Because is the book from God?

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.590
Did God inspire Matthew to say true things or false things?

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.460
The New Testament is not inspired by God.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.480
Holy shit!

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.360
The New Testament is not inspired by God.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:19.720
The authors of the synoptic gospels wrote a testimony of the things that they saw.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.920
Yeah, but they said that Jesus did things in order to fulfill prophecies.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.960
So when they said that, they weren't telling the truth.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.220
He just admitted that the New Testament is a lie.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.140
I'm glad we can finally come to some kind of agreement.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.640
I'm still here. I'm listening.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.280
I'm saying we finally got some agreement.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.580
The New Testament is not true. It's full of lies.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.060
Not all of it.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.640
Okay, but some of it.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.820
Some of it.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.260
Okay, throw it out. Dump it.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.420
If it's got lies in it, I don't want it.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:06.520
If I bring you a glass of water and I told you I only spit and part of it, are you going to drink it?

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.360
No.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.680
Yeah, right?

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:18.600
If the Bible is full of things that aren't true, I'm not likely to believe that this book is divinely inspired or is revealing some sort of sacred truth or anything of that nature.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.720
But it's not full of lies.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.960
But it is. We just read a bunch of prophecies that clearly weren't prophecies about Jesus.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.980
And it gets history wrong.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.640
We already know that.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.440
It says that the earth is flat and there's a dome over top of it.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.460
Do you think the earth is flat?

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.520
It doesn't say that if the earth is flat.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.520
In Job it says that the earth is a sphere.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.780
No, it doesn't.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.780
Job 38-14 said it's formed like clay beneath a seal.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.180
Do you know what clay beneath a seal looks like?

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.640
It said it's a sphere and it rests in the firmament.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.340
No, it doesn't.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.540
It doesn't say that.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:05.760
It says in Job 38 that the earth takes on form like clay under a seal and stands out like a garment.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:11.140
And this is what a clay seal looks like.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.480
That is the seal of Hezekiah.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.700
It looks strangely just like what people in the ancient world thought the earth looked like.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:22.480
Isn't that weird?

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.940
There's not a single passage in the Bible that says the earth is a sphere.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.080
And you're confusing Job with Isaiah 40 verse 22 that says it's a disk.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.240
It doesn't say it's a sphere.

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:54.010
The Hebrew word chag doesn't mean sphere.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.130
It means a disk or a circle.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:03.130
And in the case of the earth, it's clearly a disk because circles are hollow and disks are not.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.770
I think Gary might have something to add.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.510
Gary, you got anything to add to this?

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:29.050
Oh, just that it seems pretty silly to accept the book if so much of it is just so wrong.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.350
I don't know.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:37.770
If everything that it says is wrong, if it's just wrong about all of it, then what's the point of any of it?

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.090
Yeah.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:48.070
What percent of the Bible would need to be false for you to no longer believe in it?

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.180
Are you asking me a question?

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.140
Yeah.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.710
What percent of the Bible would need to be false for you to no longer believe in it?

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:26.520
The words of the Bible as you're relating them as false is not what makes me not believe in the Bible.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.200
The teachings in the Bible are what I believe in.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.340
So if the Bible was 100% false, would you still believe in it?

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.200
This is not a hard question.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.980
On the contrary, Doug is always hard.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:51.800
Praise Doug.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:03.370
Yeah, the problem is, if the Bible is not completely true, we have a big problem.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:10.110
We have to figure out how many untrue things does the book need to say before we just say the book's not reliable.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.250
Also, thank you, Kayla, for all the lives.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:13.150
I appreciate that.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:13.610
And Lisa.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.950
What's our tipping point?

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.030
Thank you, Philo.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.730
Big W on the whale.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:26.010
When you take it out of context, then it becomes a lie.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.370
What's the context that I took out of it?

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.280
That's right, Flanker.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.300
Flanker says that that's why flat earthers exist.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.540
They need the earth to be flat to make the Bible literally true.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.380
I agree.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.920
If Christianity disappeared tomorrow, there wouldn't be flat earthers in America.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:55.120
But how much of the Bible needs to be true before we say that it's trustworthy or untrue before we say that it's just not trustworthy?

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.840
One percent.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:58.960
One percent?

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.980
So if one percent of the Bible is untrue, then we can throw it out.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:07.360
If one percent of the Bible was true, I would believe in it.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.380
Oh, if only one percent of it was true and 99 percent was untrue, you would still believe in it?

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:14.560
Yes.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.660
When are you converting to Islam?

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.340
I am not.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.580
Let's go.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.580
Do you like sand?

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.000
What is your question?

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:36.880
Well, I'm just saying that there's a location on the other side of the pond where people practice that religion since you're converting to Islam.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.020
I'm not converting to Islam.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.420
You don't want to go be with your people?

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.560
You said, listen, the Qur'an is at least one percent true.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:46.790
I know it's true.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:48.310
Do you know that Mecca is a real place?

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:50.010
I do.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:51.790
Do you know what Mecca is?

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.410
Well, that's irrelevant.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.950
I'm saying that at least one percent of the Qur'an is true.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.890
So when are you converting to Islam?

00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.910
Do you know what Mecca is?

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:00.130
I know exactly what it is.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:00.250
Do you know what Mecca is?

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:01.190
That's irrelevant.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:09.650
We're talking about whether or not believing something because it's one percent true is a means to hang your whole life on it.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:16.110
Well, they got the Mecca from the Bible, and that's an actual historical place where Abraham...

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:17.990
Literally no one cares about that.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:22.370
So we're talking about whether or not you should believe something that's only one percent true.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.130
Why is that?

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:27.790
We're asking, should you believe something that's only one percent true?

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:32.070
And you're saying yes for the Bible, but you won't say it for the Qur'an.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.530
Hebrews 11 and 1.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:35.170
You can't do it.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:35.990
You can't bring it.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.070
All right, David, I need you to answer my question.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:38.750
All right.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:44.350
If the Qur'an is only one percent true, should we believe it?

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:51.830
People believe it.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.070
That's not an answer.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:59.580
That is not an answer, man, man.

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.340
David, I have a question for you.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:12.080
So if you bought a book on how to fix your car and only one percent of it was correct, but 99 percent was correct, would you trust that book on how to fix your car?

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.920
I would apply the part that works.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.080
How would you know?

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.480
But that didn't answer the question.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.280
That didn't answer my question, David.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.900
My question is, would you trust the book on how to fix your car?

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:35.380
If you knew you were well aware that 99 percent of the book was false, I think you can answer the question.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.800
I would take the information that I knew was false and I wouldn't apply it.

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.940
And I would apply the information that was true.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.280
But you don't know what's true and what's false when you first get the book.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.640
You just know that only one percent of it's true.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.680
So why would you buy a book knowing that 99 percent of it's not true?

00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:02.020
When you did your research as your rovers, you took out the things and you kind of elaborate on the things that you know are false.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:11.520
But you steer away, like whenever I start a conversation about the things that have been found true, you steer away from that and you keep focusing on just the things that are false.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.660
Well, I never said the Bible is 100 percent false.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.980
So that's never been a claim of mine.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.380
I've never claimed the Bible is 100 percent false.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.700
OK, so that's the part that we should go with, the parts that are true.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.000
How do you know what parts are true?

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.160
Most of them are historically accurate.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.620
Like what?

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.700
Daniel, thank you for the 200 super chat.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.620
Daniel says he will die on the road and go to heaven.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.640
I don't, I'm sorry, Daniel, I may not understand what you're saying there.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.760
So listen, if the Bible is only one percent true, it doesn't matter that it got a couple of things right.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.960
A dead clock is right twice a day.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.100
It means nothing to me.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:54:02.120
The fact that like Jerusalem exists or King David existed doesn't mean anything to me because this book is talking about someone's eternal salvation and that if you don't believe what is written in the book that you'll burn forever in eternity.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:03.980
That's not what it says.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.560
That's not what grace is at all.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.420
Yeah, you will love Jesus.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.380
Grace is not.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.160
You'll love Jesus or you will burn.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.100
Believe in the Bible.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.260
It says you will love Jesus or you will burn.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.280
Now we can talk.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.000
Yes.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.540
OK, and that's horrific.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:25.260
That is not because the book that attests to his existence is just demonstrably saying things that are untrue.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:33.660
So I have no reason to believe that Jesus is the Messiah or the son of God, which means that God gave me faulty information to make decisions on.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:42.820
So if God is going to give us faulty information to make our decisions on and then he burns us for all of eternity because of those decisions, then he's a barbarian.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.840
Will you allow me to elaborate on that?

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.020
Awesome.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.480
So the message from God is this.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.160
God says that I gave you my law.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.540
I wrote it on your hearts and it is up to you to follow that law.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:08.480
And in consequence of that law, what I'm doing is I'm offering you salvation through my salvation.

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.500
Yahweh, salvation of God, God saves.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.440
Did you say Yahweh?

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:15.460
Yes, Yeshua.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.320
You say Yeshua, Jesus.

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:23.880
So in that salvation, you have this option.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.000
You can believe and accept my salvation or you cannot.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.980
And you can suffer the consequences of sin.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.580
Where did you learn all this?

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:35.770
Through teachings.

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:36.850
From where?

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.590
From the Torah and from the Bible.

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:42.950
Oh, from the Bible, the thing that's not true.

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:43.690
Okay.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:45.910
Let's make sure we're aware.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.720
So again, it all goes back to the Bible.

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.900
The Bible's not true, then neither is Christianity.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.800
Christianity is very true.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.640
Christianity just means follower of Christ.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.120
I know.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:05.600
And the edict of the teachings of Jesus, that's what the foundation of Christianity is.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.840
Christianity is not reading the Bible.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.960
Is it okay to eat meat sacrificed to idols?

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:12.780
No.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.900
It's okay to sacrifice to God.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:15.800
No, no.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.340
I asked you, is it okay to eat meat that has been sacrificed to idols?

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:20.820
No.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:24.640
Okay, so in 1 Corinthians chapter 8, Paul was lying.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:31.310
He was talking about meat eaters.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:39.710
He says, if you come upon people who eat meat, and you do not, and you choose not to, and that's your lifestyle, you don't have to follow them.

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:40.890
Let them do them.

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.010
You follow God's commandments.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.910
David, I don't know why you keep lying on my live.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:47.410
I'm going to call you out every time.

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:51.170
It says, therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:53.150
It's not about me eating meat.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.010
It's about eating meat offered to idols.

00:56:55.010 --> 00:57:00.330
It says, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God but the one.

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:18.010
For even there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as there are many gods and many lords, yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and through whom we live.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:32.510
However, there is not in everyone that knowledge, for some with consciousness of idols, or of the idol until now, eat it as a thing offered to an idol, and their conscious being weak is defiled.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:38.230
But food does not commend us to God, neither if we eat or if we...

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.170
Holy crap, I butchered that one.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:48.990
But food does not commend us to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:54.850
But beware, lest somehow this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block for those who are weak.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:58:05.850
So he's saying to the Corinthian church, you are at liberty to eat the meat as long as you don't actually believe that this meat was sacrificed to a literal god.

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:08.090
That's not what that says.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.950
It says that they are at liberty.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:15.370
It says, but beware lest somehow this liberty of yours, liberty to do what?

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:21.170
To be a stumbling block to those who are weak.

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:21.590
No.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:22.690
You have to read the entire sentence.

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:28.870
He says, beware lest somehow this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block.

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.510
Not liberty to be a stumbling block.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:41.500
Will you eat the rest of it?

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:53.740
Yeah, it says, for if anyone sees you who have knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, will not the conscious of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols?

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.520
And because of your knowledge, shall the weak both perish for whom Christ died?

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:05.060
But when you thus sin against the brethren and wound the weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:11.820
Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat lest I make my brother stumble.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.600
So Paul is saying you are at liberty in order to eat the meat.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.640
You have the liberty, but not everybody has the same understanding as you.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:27.760
So be aware that when you're taking advantage of this liberty that you're not doing so in a way that would cause somebody else to stumble.

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:32.580
They have it in the law, and it's in most statutes in most states.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:37.560
Ignorance of the law does not necessarily grant you liberty from the law.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.860
Buddy, we're talking about whether or not these people are at liberty to eat the meat.

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.060
That's where I'm going with that.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:50.420
What he's saying is just because you don't understand that it's a sin, it's at you.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:56.200
But once you understand and realize that that's a sin, then it's for you to make that decision to not do it.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.320
Did Paul say it's a sin?

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.320
Also, MRK, thank you for the subbing.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:09.600
He says, food does not commend us to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:16.540
He's literally making the case for why you can eat the meat.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.820
Nicholas has a super chat on YouTube.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.880
Nicholas says, would you see the rapture as evidence?

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.380
Rapture is in a few weeks.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.880
Nicholas, I literally cannot wait for the rapture to happen.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.200
Get you, Christian, out of here.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.500
We can finally make some progress.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:45.360
So it literally says here that the food sacrificed to the idols doesn't bring you any closer or further from God.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.720
And then he says that you are at liberty.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.620
He says, beware of this liberty of yours.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.100
What's the liberty to do?

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.400
Whether to make that choice, whether to eat the food sacrificed to idols.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:04.500
That's right. They are at their liberty to eat that meat if they want to because those gods don't actually exist.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.680
They're not real. They're fiction.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.300
Only your God is real.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.060
Only the God of the Israelites are real.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.700
And that God gave us free will.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.120
So if you choose to live the life of sin, then that's up to you.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.820
He didn't say sin.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.280
He didn't say it was a sin.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.100
That's exactly what he said. You have to read it after.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.340
He didn't say it.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.020
Go down.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.060
No, he didn't say it.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.520
He said, causing your brethren to stumble was a sin.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.120
Yes.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.920
And what does it mean to cause your brethren to stumble in this passage?

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.140
Doing something that you know is a sin.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.300
No, incorrect.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.300
And inviting them to do.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.240
Not even close. You're wrong.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.220
I'm sorry, how?

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.120
Because you haven't listened to it.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.000
I'm going to get a translation that you can understand.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:57.920
Hold on.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.560
Here we go.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.900
I've got the International Children's Bible.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.740
We'll see if this is easier.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.000
We'll see if this reads easier.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.640
This is the bedazzled edition.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.380
It's got glitter on it.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.320
It's got pictures.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:13.920
It does have pictures.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.900
Yes, it's got pictures.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.180
Let's see.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.320
It says, so this is what I say about eating meat sacrifice to idols.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.400
We know what an idol is really.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.720
Nothing in the world.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.300
And we know that there is only one God.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:33.420
It is really not important if there are things called gods in heaven or on earth.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.000
And there are many things that people call gods and lords.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.920
But for us, there is only one God.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.160
He is our father.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.900
All things come from him and we live for him.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.540
And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.520
All things were made through Jesus Christ.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.540
And we also have life through him.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.200
But not all people know this.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.480
Until now, some people have had the habit of worshipping idols.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:02.460
So now, when they eat meat, they still feel as if it belongs to an idol.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.840
They are not sure that this is right to eat the meat.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.260
When they eat it, they feel guilty.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.960
But food will not make us closer to God.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.340
Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.340
And eating does not make us better in God's sight.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:29.580
I'm hoping that you caught that because he's referring to the people who are eating the meat sacrificed to idols.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.480
Because they feel that that's going to bring them closer to their God.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.920
But there is only one God and he does not permit that.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.840
Yes, the people who believe in the idols.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.800
Yes, that's who he's talking to.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.500
No, he's not talking to them.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.060
He's not talking to them.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:53.560
And they are the ones that are causing their brothers to stumble because they're inviting their brothers to eat the same meat offered to the idols.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.140
You are, again, lying.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.520
So what it literally says is that they are at liberty to eat the meat offered to idols.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:08.240
But since there are some among them who believe that eating the meat is akin to idolatry,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.940
then you can't cause them to stumble by causing them to eat the meat.

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.480
You're saying you're at liberty to do so.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.000
Right. You said the same thing.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.800
You personally are at liberty to eat the meat is what he's saying.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.580
Just don't do it in a way that causes your brethren to stumble.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.460
The brethren are the followers of Christ.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:33.400
It's some of them who have a background of idolatry.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.640
I wonder if they have the ICB up here.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.780
Maybe the message, maybe we can find the message on here.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.180
Yeah, here's the message.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.820
Maybe this will be easier.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.360
Some people say, quite rightly, that idols have no actual existence.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.420
And there is nothing to them, that there is no God other than our one God,

01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:00.420
that no matter how many of these so-called gods are named and worshiped, they still don't add up to anything but a tall story.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.600
Okay, so you understand what he's saying?

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.360
You're saying these guys don't really exist.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.040
That's why you're at liberty.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.260
The idols don't exist, correct.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:18.060
That's why you are at liberty to eat the meat as long as you're not doing it in a way that causes others to stumble.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.540
Correct, we're saying the same thing.

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.920
Okay, I'm glad we can finally figure that out.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.220
Okay, so according to Paul then, according to his letter to the Corinthians,

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.880
are the brethren who don't believe in these idols, are they allowed to eat the meat?

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.420
They are not.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.820
Okay, show me where it says that they're not.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.200
He's talking to the Corinthians.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.940
Yes, the whole Church.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.760
No, the Corinthians Church is the Father of Christ.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.700
He's going to the Church.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.880
He's talking to the Corinthians, to the non-believers.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:51.800
The Corinthian Church.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.040
No, he's not.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.560
He's quite literally singled them out as a different people group.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.540
He says, it is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge.

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:10.420
Some have become so accustomed to idols until now that they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol,

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.480
and their conscious being weak is defiled.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:14.980
Yes.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.720
I literally cannot believe that this is hard for you.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.660
Paul is making a very easy definitive statement.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.960
Because these gods don't actually exist, as long as you don't believe in these gods,

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.400
and you don't feel guilty about it, you can eat the meat.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:33.760
So what are you saying?

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:40.720
Yes, but if you cause the power of Christ, who is not a Corinth, to do the same,

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.860
then that's how you're defiling God.

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.500
Yes, if you're doing it in a way that causes someone to stumble.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.300
But he didn't say it was a sin.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.060
He says you are at liberty to do it.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.240
Thou shall have no other God before me.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.140
That is a sin.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.660
It doesn't say anything about worshipping idols.

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.080
It's talking about eating the meat.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:08.420
If you sacrifice a meat to something that is not God, then that's basically the same thing.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.620
It doesn't say anything about offering sacrifices.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.440
It's talking about eating the meat that somebody else sacrificed.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.360
Yes, and it says that you're at liberty to do it.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.000
The people of Corinth are at liberty to do it, not the powers of Christ.

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.740
No, wrong. It doesn't say that.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.420
It doesn't say that.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.540
David, stop it. David, stop lying on my live.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.120
This letter is not addressed to the Corinthian non-church people.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.840
Also, Solo, thank you for the five dollars.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.740
Solo says, tell guests it's okay.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.120
When I was a Christian, I didn't read my Bible either.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.140
Yeah, that's pretty much how that works.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.460
This letter is addressed to the Corinthian church, not to the Corinthian citizens.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.660
Please stop lying on your book.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:08:02.420
Can I also say that maybe Christians should stop reading other people's mail and thinking it was sent to them?

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.180
Who does that?

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.200
That's breaking man's law. That's not God's law.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.780
God says read everything.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.780
God says read everything.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.880
Even like this guy said, he said I should read the Koran.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.260
God says read everything.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:32.460
No, no, no. Even if the letters of Paul were accurate, the Corinthian church doesn't even exist anymore.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.020
No, it does not.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520
The Church of Corinth, I should say.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.020
They were killed. They were killed.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.740
Why do you think that this applies to you?

01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:47.330
What, the worship, eating meat, worship, are provided to idols?

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:51.470
The Church of Corinth, why do you think it applies to you?

01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:00.960
The only thing that I'm taking away from that is God's law, which says you should not eat meat that was sacrificed to idols.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:08.960
Is this a law that aligns with the Old Testament?

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.560
It does.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:18.000
Oh, so if the Old Testament says that something is permissible or not permissible, then that's what it is?

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.840
According to the Hebrew faith, yes.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.720
So we were allowed to own slaves then.

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:33.250
Okay, what the American people defined as slavery.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.010
There it goes. There it goes.

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:39.390
And what slavery was back then, they were indentured.

01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:55.430
What you did, if you read the book of Genesis, his name was Jacob, and he permitted himself to be an indentured servant to Rebecca's dad for seven years because he wanted to marry Rebecca.

01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:00.390
He gave him Leah instead, and he committed himself to another.

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:01.170
We know the story.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:02.290
Of course, slavery.

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:03.470
We all know the story.

01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:05.310
We know the story better than you do, in fact.

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:08.230
Okay, so we're not talking about indentured servants.

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.850
We're talking about actual slaves.

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:21.990
It says in Leviticus 25, as for your male and female slaves who you may have, it is from the nations around you that you, sorry, nations around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves.

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:31.210
Moreover, you may buy the children of strangers who dwell among you and their families who are with you, which they beget in your land, and they shall become your property.

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:42.590
And you shall make them as an inheritance for your children, or sorry, you will take them as an inheritance for your children after you, for them to inherit them as a possession, and they will be your permanent slaves.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.770
Yeah.

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.650
Forever.

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:48.610
And also it goes into the treatment of those people.

01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:49.470
Oh, hold on.

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:53.930
David, David, you're moving the goalpost, and you're lying again.

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:57.010
So right now, it doesn't say indentured servants.

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.250
It doesn't say for six years go free in the seventh.

01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:01.750
It says they are your permanent slaves.

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:02.590
Do you agree?

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:04.310
I agree.

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:06.750
Okay, so you could have slaves permanently.

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:09.130
You could.

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:10.870
Fantastic. I'm glad we can come.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:12.650
Okay, so God does condone slavery.

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.110
Do you think that slavery is wrong?

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.660
In that sense, it was not wrong because he also goes over the treatment of those.

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:25.060
Okay, so slavery is okay as long as you treat your slaves kindly.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.000
Exactly.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:27.500
Okay.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.680
Should you be allowed to beat your slaves?

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:31.240
No.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:31.820
Okay.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.620
Because it says that in Leviticus as well.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.440
You can't.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.380
Do you think the problem with American slavery was that they just didn't treat their slaves well enough?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.040
They didn't treat them well at all.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.760
What do you mean?

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.340
But if they treated them better, do you think slavery would have been fine?

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.640
If they treated them according to the Hebrew law, then it would have been fine.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:52.500
What?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.300
Hebrew law says you can beat them with a rod.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.500
If they commit a crime.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.540
It didn't say that.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.640
It says if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod and that he is unalived under his hand, he shall surely be punished.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.280
He shall surely be punished. There you go.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:10.920
Keep reading.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.780
Notwithstanding, if he remains alive for a day or two, he shall not be punished because he is his property.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.900
So if he survived...

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.400
He didn't get a rod because he broke the law.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.260
It didn't say that.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.400
It didn't say anything about breaking the law.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.740
He didn't tie him to a post and beat the hell out of him just because of his skin color.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.220
How do you know?

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:29.780
That's a difference.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.980
Oh, the skin color is irrelevant.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:35.060
We're not talking about that. We're talking about owning slaves and whether or not you can beat them.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.800
Again, Hebrew law defines slavery as different.

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.700
It says you can beat them and you can own them for life.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:42.680
Okay.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:43.840
That's slavery.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.460
So what was wrong with the Atlantic slave trade?

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.300
The people who brought the slaves over were corrupt.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.060
And the people who owned the slaves here were corrupt.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.360
That's totally different.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.800
So good God-fearing people can own slaves.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.480
And treat them correctly, yes.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.700
So you're pro-slavery then as long as it's good people doing it.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.100
I'm pro-slavery as long as they follow the tenets of God and they don't mistreat their slaves.

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.460
There we go. We heard it.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.820
Do you think that you should be able to own slaves, David?

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.540
Because they feed their slaves.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:22.980
They take care of their slaves.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.400
They give their slaves housing.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:25.980
Should you be able to?

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.080
And they pay their slaves.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.840
Should you be able to own slaves, David?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.240
You're a good Christian.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.040
You treat your slaves very well.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.440
Should you be able to own them?

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.240
He's talking to you.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.800
He's talking to you.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.580
Oh, you're talking to me?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.320
What was your question?

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.840
Okay, what was your question?

01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.560
Should you be able to own slaves?

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.880
If you treat them well, you're a good Christian.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.100
Should you be able to own slaves, you specifically?

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:05.760
Do you want to own slaves?

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.360
I don't want to own slaves.

01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:13.330
Would you be too cruel of an owner?

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:14.110
I'm confused.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.150
Why wouldn't you want slaves?

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.210
I wouldn't be too cruel of an owner.

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:21.790
If the option were given to me and I was able to hire help, then yes, I would.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.190
But I would treat them correctly.

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:25.470
You would own slaves?

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.930
I would own slaves and I would treat them correctly.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:30.290
Oh my God.

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:33.970
What the f-

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:42.290
And again, because the premise that America has put on it through the 400 years that they owned slaves and how they treated them,

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:46.330
people automatically think that's the assumption of owning a slave and how slaves are treated.

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:48.230
They automatically think it's bad.

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:54.290
But the English, when England populated India and Northern Africa, they didn't treat them that way.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:55.250
They were slaves.

01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:57.130
Well, I want to continue this.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.990
But before we do, Aaron, thank you so much for the $50 Super Chat.

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:02.970
Also, Philo Dragon, big W for that, Aaron.

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:05.370
Aaron says, your secular Bible study is the best.

01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:06.370
We appreciate you so much.

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:07.670
I really appreciate you as well.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.250
Big W, I appreciate that.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:10.290
I appreciate you too, sir.

01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:11.690
I appreciate you too.

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:17.150
So, David, are you suggesting then that slavery wasn't so bad?

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.040
The treatment of the slaves in American culture was bad.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.900
The treatment of the slaves in the West Indian and Caribbean culture was bad.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.540
Should we be allowed to sell our daughters as slaves?

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:36.610
Like if I have a daughter, because Exodus says if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave,

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:38.470
she should not go out as the male slaves do.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.590
Obviously, she gets to be-

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:40.590
Correctly. There you go.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:41.550
She gets to be, yes.

01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:48.130
So we should be allowed to sell our female daughters, our children, as slaves without their consent?

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:53.650
That is under the Hebrew law.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:54.930
It is different than American law.

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:57.250
Okay, so we should be allowed to do it then.

01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:58.850
Yes.

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:04.630
Hey, David, would you be okay with being owned as property?

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.270
I'm owned right now.

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:09.230
You should see my job.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:10.770
I'm very much owned.

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:11.990
I'm underpaid.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:13.750
Getting owned.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.810
This is a great metaphor.

01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:20.970
We're talking about literal, like literally owned.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:23.510
Would you be okay with literally being legally owned?

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:25.850
Jesus owns me now, yes.

01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.190
I would be okay with being owned.

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:30.970
Would you be my slave, David?

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:34.310
You're treating me right, absolutely.

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:35.770
Oh, dear God.

01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:37.050
Tyler, thank you for the $5.

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:42.490
Tyler says Christianity is an effing joke, and David is the proof.

01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:48.070
Listen, David, I love you, but you lost me at slavery is cool,

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:51.430
and that women should be executed for not being virgins.

01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:55.410
I'm sure you're a delightful human being.

01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:58.410
Women are not executed for being virgins.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:00.990
They're executed because they broke the law and committed adultery.

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.090
Your beliefs are loony tunes.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.190
Dex, thank you for the $5 super chat.

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:09.090
Dex says this is why Christianity is a red flag

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:13.630
and causes good people to defend the most vile things in human history.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:19.470
No, when bad people do bad things and put it in the name of Christianity, that's why it's bad.

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:20.270
I'm sure.

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:22.090
Yeah, God does terrible things, too.

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:23.090
For example.

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.810
God does not.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:24.670
God is holy.

01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:29.690
Do you think that people being punished for other people's crimes is good?

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:30.730
Didn't we already cover this?

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:32.670
No, we did not.

01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:35.490
You're talking about the consecration that came from Adam.

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:35.970
No.

01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:36.930
When Adam committed sin.

01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:37.550
Not even close.

01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:39.190
Not even close to what I'm talking about.

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:40.430
Okay, what are you talking about?

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:41.170
What are you talking about?

01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:52.490
Yes.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.310
So these 70,000 people paid the price for David's sin.

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:21.890
If you read 1 Chronicles, it'll tell you that Lucifer came to David and he said,

01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:23.430
go out and number the people.

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:23.850
Yeah, Satan.

01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:28.010
God specifically told David not to do that.

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:28.090
Sure.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.130
Can you show me that passage?

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.950
Show me the passage where God said not to do it.

01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:35.370
Also, it doesn't matter because David committed the sin, not the people.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.360
And the people were under his rule.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:39.780
Yeah.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.960
And what was their crime?

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.280
Well, their crime was being numbered.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:53.320
Okay, show me the law where it says that you can't take a census.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.520
Well, you got counted.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.440
I guess that means that you deserve to no longer be alive.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.020
Yeah.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.220
What a terrible human being.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:11.680
Your king, the guy who has life or death power over you, wants to number you.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.800
And if you agree, God will kill you.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:21.020
Even though David is supposed to be God's anointed person, you're supposed to listen to what he says.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.690
1 Chronicles chapter 21 verse 1.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:30.250
Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:34.330
David said to Joab and the commanders of the army.

01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.570
David, stop.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:35.870
We've read it.

01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:36.970
We know what it says.

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:41.090
I'm asking you, where can I find it where God says don't take a census?

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.040
Where's that law?

01:19:56.270 --> 01:20:02.290
Because what we find here in the actual passage, David cries out, says when David, I'm sorry.

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:09.230
Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking the people and he said, surely I have sinned and I have done wickedly.

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:10.870
But these sheep, what have they done?

01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:13.930
Let your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father's house.

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:16.350
So David knows that he's the one that sinned.

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:20.330
I agree with that.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.010
So these people were being punished for David's sin.

01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:29.870
The people were being punished because they did what David told them to do.

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:31.630
Which was not actually a sin.

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.370
There's no law against taking a census.

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.910
It's literally the prerogative of the king to do so.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.100
All right, listen, David, I think you've been thoroughly cooked and I've got to get to bed.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.020
I've got a long day tomorrow.
